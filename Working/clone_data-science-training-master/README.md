### Rendering

```R
rmarkdown::render_site(encoding = 'UTF-8')
````

This will build the HTML and PDF versions of the book into the `docs/` folder, which should not be directly edited (and occassionally completely deleted before rendering to remove old unused files).

### Teaching Setup

This book as been used for Software Carpentry workshops and the OHI Fellows program (recordings on the [OHI-Science YouTube Channel](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xpe7jmt0-J4&list=PLX7J3qtjcll_4s2oaKHuWdRdBMJz7tBAU)).

Prior to teaching:

- open a clean RStudio session with default panes
- github chapter: since `my-repo` has been created, consider `[placename]-repo` e.g. `whoi-repo`
- before ggplot2 chapter: `install.packages('tidyverse')`

# Welcome {#welcome}

Welcome to the Mathematical Marine Ecology Lab. 

This book has been put together as the main source of information for all members of the MME Lab. It includes info on lab meetings, administration, data-storage, open data-science, R programming, writing skills and GitHub. 

## Lab Meetings

The MME lab meets up every week on Level 5 of the Queenland Bioscience Precinct. We generally use this as an opportunity to catch up on what everyone is doing, and share tips and tricks around data, programming and open data-science. Each meeting, one person is nominated to lead a discussion on a specific topic. Contact Anthony to be added to the email list. You can also attend virtually.

## General Administration

### Lab Contact:
For any lab-specific issues, you should contact Anthony in the first instance:
Professory Anthony Richardson: ajr at maths.uq.edu.au

### SMP Contacts

### General IT Support

## Lab Communication {#comm}

In progress......

### Email

For formal communication that must be received and read. 

### GitHub Issues Tracking

For specific questions and issue tracking that relates to a project. Each issue can have its own converstaion chain. Tag people to notify them of something they need to deal with.

### Gitter

For idle chit-chat, tips/tricks, cool papers etc. Things that are not critical for people to see in a short timeframe. 

## Useful Tools

### Software



### R Resources

**R for Data Science** (Otherwise known as R4DS) by Hadley Wickham and Garrett Grolemund. This book will teach you how to do data science with R: You’ll learn how to get your data into R, get it into the most useful structure, transform it, visualise it and model it.   
https://r4ds.had.co.nz


**Advanced R** by Hadley Wickham. This book is designed primarily for R users who want to improve their programming skills and understanding of the language   
http://adv-r.had.co.nz


**R Graphics Cookbook** by Winston Chang. This book is a practical guide that provides more than 150 recipes to help you generate high-quality graphs quickly, without having to comb through all the details of R’s graphing systems.   
https://r-graphics.org


**R Packages** by Hadley Wickham. The goal of this book is to teach you how to develop packages so that you can write your own, not just use other people’s.    
http://r-pkgs.had.co.nz


**Text Mining with R** by Julia Silge and David Robinson. This book serves as an introduction of text mining using the tidytext package and other tidy tools in R.    
https://www.tidytextmining.com


**Bookdown** by Yihui Xie. This book introduces an R package, bookdown, to change your workflow of writing books, websites or even theses. It was how we put together this website.  
https://bookdown.org/yihui/bookdown/


### R Packages

**The Tidyverse**  
https://www.tidyverse.org  
The tidyverse is an opinionated collection of R packages designed for data science. All packages share an underlying design philosophy, grammar, and data structures. 

**Stars Package**  
https://r-spatial.github.io/stars/  
STARS is good for non-regular grid, which is what the hi-res oceanographic models generally are these days.

**ClimateOperators package**  
https://github.com/markpayneatwork/ClimateOperators  
Useful for being able to run CDO in R.

**TidyText Package**  
https://github.com/juliasilge/tidytext  
Text mining using dplyr, ggplot2, and other tidy tools 

## Open Data Science

While we have always made our data and code available to those who have asked, in 2019 the MME Lab has decided to adopt a full open data-science model. We attended the wonderful Data Science Training (http://ohi-science.org/data-science-training/) run by the _The Ocean Health Index Team_. We acknowledge all the help and resources they have made available which has allowed us to get up and running so quickly.

Many sections of this book introduce open data science so we can work with data in an open, reproducible, and collaborative way. Open data science means that methods, data, and code are available so that others can access, reuse, and build from it without much fuss. Here we demonstrate a workflow with R, RStudio, Git, and GitHub, as described in [Lowndes *et al. 2017, Nature Ecology & Evolution*: Our path to better science in less time using open data science tools](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41559-017-0160).


## Online Code of Conduct

We have adopted the code of conduct from Mozilla to govern participation in all online communities associated with the MME Lab, including GitHub, Gitter, GoogleDocs, email and lab meetings. 
As part of this we must always:

- Be respectful and value each other’s ideas, styles and viewpoints.
- Be direct but professional; we cannot withhold hard truths.
- Be inclusive and help new perspectives be heard.
- Be open to learning from others.
- Lead by example and match your actions with your words.

For a full description of the Community Participation Guidelines see:  https://www.mozilla.org/en-US/about/governance/policies/participation/



### Student Support

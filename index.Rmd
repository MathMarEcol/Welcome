# Welcome {#welcome}

Welcome to the Mathematical Marine Ecology Lab. 

This book has been put together as the main source of information for all members of the MME Lab. It includes info on lab meetings, administration, data-storage, open data-science, R programming, writing skills and GitHub. 

## Lab Meetings

The MME lab meets up every fortnight in the on Level 5 of the Queenland Bioscience Precinct. We generally use this as an opportunity to catch up on what everyone is doing, and share tips and tricks around data, programming and open data-science. Each meeting, one person is nominated to lead a discussion on a specific topic. Contact Anthony to be added to the email list. You can also attend virtually.

## General Administration

### Lab Contact:
For any lab-specific issues, you should contact Anthony in the first instance:

## Open Data Science

While we have always made our data and code available to those who have asked, in 2019 the MME Lab has decided to adopt a full open data-science model. We attended the wonderful Data Science Training (http://ohi-science.org/data-science-training/) run by the _The Ocean Health Index Team_. We acknowledge all the help and resources they have made available which has allowed us to get up and running so quickly.

Many sections of this book introduce open data science so we can work with data in an open, reproducible, and collaborative way. Open data science means that methods, data, and code are available so that others can access, reuse, and build from it without much fuss. Here we demonstrate a workflow with R, RStudio, Git, and GitHub, as described in [Lowndes *et al. 2017, Nature Ecology & Evolution*: Our path to better science in less time using open data science tools](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41559-017-0160).


## Online Code of Conduct

We have adopted the code of conduct from Mozilla to govern participation in all online communities associated with the MME Lab, including GitHub, Gitter, GoogleDocs, email and lab meetings. 
As part of this we must always:
- Be respectful and value each otherâ€™s ideas, styles and viewpoints.
- Be direct but professional; we cannot withhold hard truths.
- Be inclusive and help new perspectives be heard.
- Be open to learning from others.
- Lead by example and match your actions with your words.

### Student Support

The University of Queensland Student Support Services can be found at: https://www.uq.edu.au/student-services/

This includes information and support services for student welfare, learning support, faith, health etc. All students are encouraged to familiarise themseleves with this page.

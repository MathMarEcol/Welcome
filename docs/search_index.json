This book has been put together as the main source of information for all members of the MME Lab. It includes info on lab meetings, administration, data-storage, open data-science, R programming, writing skills and GitHub. 1.1 Lab Meetings The MME lab meets up every fortnight in the on Level 5 of the Queenland Bioscience Precinct. We generally use this as an opportunity to catch up on what everyone is doing, and share tips and tricks around data, programming and open data-science. Each meeting, one person is nominated to lead a discussion on a specific topic. Contact Anthony to be added to the email list. You can also attend virtually. 1.2 General Administration 1.2.1 Lab Contact: For any lab-specific issues, you should contact Anthony in the first instance: Professory Anthony Richardson: ajr@maths.uq.edu.au 1.2.2 SMP Contacts 1.2.3 General IT Support All general UQ IT-related information can be found at: https://my.uq.edu.au/information-and-services/information-technology 1.2.4 High Performance Computing Core Computational Facility @ UQ School of Mathematics and Physics http://research.smp.uq.edu.au/computing/ Howto - SMP getafix cluster http://research.smp.uq.edu.au/computing/getafix.html Howto - SLURM Queuing Systems http://research.smp.uq.edu.au/computing/slurm.html Howto - Run GPU Calculations http://research.smp.uq.edu.au/computing/gpu.html 1.3 Open Data Science While we have always made our data and code available to those who have asked, in 2019 the MME Lab has decided to adopt a full open data-science model. We attended the wonderful Data Science Training (http://ohi-science.org/data-science-training/) run by the The Ocean Health Index Team. We acknowledge all the help and resources they have made available which has allowed us to get up and running so quickly. Many sections of this book introduce open data science so we can work with data in an open, reproducible, and collaborative way. Open data science means that methods, data, and code are available so that others can access, reuse, and build from it without much fuss. Here we demonstrate a workflow with R, RStudio, Git, and GitHub, as described in Lowndes et al. 2017, Nature Ecology &amp; Evolution: Our path to better science in less time using open data science tools. 1.4 Online Code of Conduct We have adopted the code of conduct from Mozilla to govern participation in all online communities associated with the MME Lab, including GitHub, Gitter, GoogleDocs, email and lab meetings. As part of this we must always: - Be respectful and value each other’s ideas, styles and viewpoints. - Be direct but professional; we cannot withhold hard truths. - Be inclusive and help new perspectives be heard. - Be open to learning from others. - Lead by example and match your actions with your words. For a full description of the Community Participation Guidelines see: https://www.mozilla.org/en-US/about/governance/policies/participation/ 1.4.1 Student Support The University of Queensland Student Support Services can be found at: https://www.uq.edu.au/student-services/ This includes information and support services for student welfare, learning support, faith, health etc. All students are encouraged to familiarise themseleves with this page.

It is a direct close from the OHI Training Workbook. ## Objectives After today you will be able to start incorporating GitHub into your workflow. This will change you life (for the better!) Github was developed for social coding (i.e., sort of like an open source Wikipedia for programmers). Consequently, much of the functionality and terminology of Github (e.g., branches and pull requests) will not be relevant for most scientists. We will skip over all this stuff! To get the full functionality of Github, you will eventually want to learn other concepts. But, this can wait. Basically, we have figured out exactly what you need to know to get started! 4.1 What are Git and Github? Git and GitHub are two distinct programs, but I think of them as a bundle because I always use them together. Git is a version control system that lets you track changes to files over time. Github is a website for storing your git versioned files remotely. It has many nice features to be able visualize differences between images, rendering &amp; diffing map data files, render text data files, and track changes in text. 4.2 Why should scientists use GitHub? Ends (or, nearly ends) the horror of keeping track of versions. Basically, we get away from this: When you open your repository, you only see the most recent version. But, it easy to compare versions, and you can easily revert to previous versions. Provides peace of mind because you make changes to your work…and know that you can easily access earlier versions. Improves collaborative efforts. Different researchers can work on the same files at the same time! It is easy to share and distribute files through the Github website. Your files are available anywhere, you just need internet connection! We’ll interface with GitHub from our local computers using RStudio because it works well with the R/RStudio workflow. But, there are many other ways to interact with GitHub, including GitHub’s Desktop App or the command line (here is Jenny Bryan’s list of git clients). At some point you will need to use the command line to interface with Git, but this isn’t necessary for starting. There are great resources for learning the command line, check out this tutorial from SWC at UCSB. 4.3 Resources These are materials we borrow from: Jenny Bryan’s lectures from STAT545 at UBC: The Shell Jenny Bryan’s Happy git with R tutorial Melanie Frazier’s GitHub Quickstart Ben Best’s Software Carpentry at UCSB 4.4 Let’s get started 4.4.1 Some Github terminology User: A Github account for you (e.g., jules32). Organization: The Github account for one or more user (e.g., datacarpentry). Repository: A folder within the organization that includes files dedicated to a project. Local Github: Copies of Github files located your computer. Remote Github: Github files located on the https://github.com website. Clone: Process of making a local copy of a remote Github repository. This only needs to be done once (unless you mess up your local copy). Pull: Copy changes on the remote Github repository to your local Github repository. This is useful if multiple people are making changes to a repository. Push: Save local changes to remote Github After we set up git on your computers, we’ll explore the full GitHub process: create a repository on GitHub.com clone locally using RStudio learn the RStudio-GitHub workflow by syncing to Github.com: pull, stage, commit, push explore github.com: files, commit history, file history practice the RStudio-GitHub workflow by editing and adding files practice R Markdown 4.4.2 Setup Git &amp; GitHub The GitHub setup is a one-time thing! You will only have to do this once per computer. We’ll walk through this together. NOTE: If you are a student you can get the micro account which includes 5 private repositories for free (normally a $7/month value). You can sign up for the student account here. Instructors can also request a free organization account, “Request a discount”. Download and install Git (https://git-scm.com/downloads) Create a Github account at http://github.com, if you don’t already have one. For a username, I recommend all lower-case letters, short as you can. I recommend using your .edu email, since you can request free private repositories via GitHub Education discount. You will use the usethis package to configure git with global commands, which means it will apply ‘globally’ to all files on your computer, rather than to a specific folder. install.packages(&quot;usethis&quot;) library(usethis) use_git_config(user.name = &quot;Melsteroni&quot;, user.email = &quot;Melsteroni@example.org&quot;) BACKUP PLAN If usethis fails, the following is the classic approach to configuring git. Open the Git Bash program (Windows) or the Terminal (Mac) and type the following: # display your version of git git --version # replace USER with your Github user account git config --global user.name USER # replace NAME@EMAIL.EDU with the email you used to register with Github git config --global user.email NAME@EMAIL.EDU # list your config to confirm user.* variables set git config --list Make sure Git and RStudio are tallking: Click on “Project (None)” on the top right –&gt; “New Project” –&gt; “Version Control” –&gt; Git Do any ominous messages pop up? 4.4.2.1 Troubleshooting If you have problems setting up git, please see the Troubleshooting section in Jenny Bryan’s amazing HappyGitWithR. New(ish) Error on a Mac We’ve also seen the following errors from RStudio: error key does not contain a section --global terminal and fatal: not in a git directory To solve this, go to the Terminal and type: which git Look at the filepath that is returned. Does it say anything to do with Apple? -&gt; If yes, then the Git you downloaded isn’t installed, please redownload if necessary, and follow instructions to install. -&gt; If no, (in the example image, the filepath does not say anything with Apple) then proceed below: In RStudio, navigate to: Tools &gt; Global Options &gt; Git/SVN. Does the “Git executable” filepath match what the url in Terminal says? If not, click the browse button and navigate there. Note: on my laptop, even though I navigated to /usr/local/bin/git, it then automatically redirect because /usr/local/bin/git was an alias on my computer. That is fine. Click OK. Quit RStudio. Then relaunch RStudio. Try syncing or cloning, and if that works and then you don’t need to worry about typing into the Terminal, you’re all done! 4.4.3 Create a repository on Github.com First, go to your account on github.com and click “New repository”. Choose a name. Call it whatever you want (the shorter the better), or follow me for convenience. I will call mine quickstart. Also, add a description, make it public, create a README file, and create your repo! The Add gitignore option adds a document where you can identify files or file-types you want Github to ignore. These files will stay in on the local Github folder (the one on your computer), but will not be uploaded onto the web version of Github. The Add a license option adds a license that describes how other people can use your Github files (e.g., open source, but no one can profit from them, etc.). We won’t worry about this today. Check out our new repository! Notice how the README.md file we created is automatically displayed at the bottom. The .md means that it is Markdown (remember how .Rmd was RMarkdown?) so the formatting we learned in the last lesson apply here. From here, you will work locally (on your computer). 4.4.4 Clone your repository using RStudio We are going to be cloning a copy of our remote repository on Github.com to our local computers. Unlike downloading, cloning keeps all the version control and user information bundled with the files. Step 0: Create your github folder This is really important! We need to be organized and deliberate about where we want to keep all of our GitHub repositories (since this is the first of many in your career). Let’s all make a folder called github (all lowercase!) in our home directories. So it will look like this: Windows: Users\\[User]\\Documents\\github\\ Mac: Users/[User]/github/ This will let us take advantage of something that is really key about GitHub.com: cloned repositories are saved as folders that you can navigate on your computer. The greatness of this will be evident soon. So really. Make sure that you have an all-lowercase folder called github in your home directory!! Step 1: Copy the web address of the repository you want to clone. Step 2: from RStudio, go to New Project (also in the File menu). Step 3: Select Version Control Step 4: Select Git Step 5: Paste it in the Repository URL field, and type tab to autofill the Project Directory name. Make sure you keep the Project Directory Name THE SAME as the repository name from the URL. Save it in your github folder (click on Browse) to do this. 4.4.5 Inspect results If everything went well, the repository will be added to the list located here: when we cloned this from RStudio, it created an RStudio project, which you can tell because: - our working directory is set to `~/github/Quickstart` - there&#39;s an `.RProj` file in the &quot;Files&quot; tab - the project is named in the top right hand corner - we have a git tab! This is how we will interface with Github.com When you first clone a repo through RStudio, RStudio will add an .Rproj file to your repo folder. If you didn’t add a .gitignore file when you originally created the repo on GitHub.com, RStudio will also add this for you. These will show up with little yellow ? icons in your git tab. This is GitHub’s way of saying: “ooohh…..something changed in the repository”. In this case, when you click the box to stage them, they will turn into As because they have been added to the repo. And the repository will be saved to the Github folder on your computer: Ta da!!!! The folder doesn’t contain much of interest, but we are going to change that. 4.4.6 Add files to our local repo The repository will contain: .gitignore file README.md Rproj And, I typically create the following: folders for “data” and “figures” R scripts etc. We can use the Git tab of RStudio to monitor changes to files in the local repository. When files change, RStudio uses the following codes to describe how the files have been modified: We will demonstrate this by copying a file into the repository folder on my computer. This file will be added to the Git tab beside a green box with an “A”! From this, you can see how the repository is being tracked, even when changes aren’t made through RStudio. We can also make changes through RStudio! 4.4.7 Committing your changes and syncing with GitHub.com Eventually you will want to commit the files you have created in your local repository and then send them to GitHub.com I tend to do this every time I finish a task (basically when I start getting nervous that I will lose my work). Once something is committed, it is very difficult to lose it. Committing saves the current saved version of your files to the official Git History. The commit includes all the staged files as well as a corresponding commit message (which you will write) and a unique identifier called a SHA ID. When you are ready to commit your changes, follow these steps: We walk through this process below: 4.4.7.1 Pull From the Git tab, “Pull” the repository. This makes sure your local repository is synced with the remote repository. This is very important if other people are making changes to the repository or if you are working from multiple computers. 4.4.7.2 Stage Stage the files you want to commit. In RStudio, this involves checking the “Staged” boxes: 4.4.7.3 Commit Add a commit message that describes the updates you made to these files. The message will be for your reference, so make it something you will find useful. 4.4.7.4 Push You will “Push” to save your local changes to Github.com. 4.5 Explore remote Github The files you added should be on github.com: Your turn! This time let’s edit an existing file instead of adding something new. Open your README file by clicking on it in the Files pane (lower right corner). Write a few lines of text, save, and see what happens in your Git Tab. Sync it to your remote repository (Github.com). Also, go to your Finder/Windows Explorer, and copy-paste something into your local GitHub repo. Then go back to RStudio and confirm that git tracked it. Remember, git will track anything within that folder (the way Dropbox does), it’s not specific to RStudio! Create a new R Markdown file Now, we are going to return to using R Markdown so you can write notes to yourself in Markdown and have a record of all your R code. Writing R commands in the console like we did this morning is great, but limited; it’s hard to keep track of and hard to efficiently share with others. Plus, as your analyses get more complicated, it basically becomes impossible to use. Go to File &gt; New File &gt; R Markdown … (or click the green plus in the top left corner). Let’s set up this file so we can use it later. I’m going to replace all the automatic text with the following: --- title: &quot;Graphics with ggplot2&quot; author: &quot;Julie&quot; date: &quot;11/21/2017&quot; output: html_document --- # Learning ggplot2 We&#39;re learning ggplot2 It&#39;s going to be amazing. Now, let’s save it. I’m going to call my file ggplot2.Rmd. Then, sync your file to GitHub. What if a file doesn’t show up in the Git tab and you expect that it should? Check to make sure you’ve saved the file. If the filename is red with an asterix, there have been changes since it was saved. Remember to save before syncing to GitHub! 4.6 Going back in time One thing that I love about about Github is that it is easy to see how files have changed over time. Usually I compare commits through github.com: You can click on the commits to see how the files changed from the previous commit: 4.7 Happy Git with R If you have problems, we’ll help you out using Jenny Bryan’s HappyGitWithR, particularly the sections on Detect Git from RStudio and RStudio, Git, GitHub Hell (troubleshooting). So as we are coming around, have a look at it and see if you can help troubleshoot too! "],

All you do is sit down at a typewriter and bleed.” Ernest Hemingway Writing can be a lot of work! “If I had more time I would have written a shorter letter” Blaize Pascal, 1657 Writing can invoke strong feelings! “Here is a lesson in creative writing. The first rule: do not use semicolons. They are transvestite hermaphrodites representing absolutely nothing. All they do is show you’ve been to college” Kurt Vonnegut, The Man Without a Country Writing can be fun! “To write is human, to edit is divine.” Stephen King 5.1.1 What is good scientific writing? Maybe a truthful but uninformative answer is “You know when you read it!”. Being able to understand the message easily is clearly essential. But so is being concise, as words cost journals money and scientists have limited time to read your work. But good scientific writing is more than just being clear and concise. For example, newspaper articles can be clear and concise, but most would say that the journalistic style is inappropriate in a scientific setting. Scientific writing has a host of conventions, not all of which are always made explicit. For example, adhering to the typical structure of a scientific paper, not using colloquialisms, not providing opinion, and not being emotive, to name a few. Although it might feel that such “rules” take the fun out of writing, good scientific writing should not be bland and boring to read. There is room, and indeed a need, for creativity. 5.1.2 Why write well? There are many reasons why as scientists we need to write well. First, science is about ideas, and we need to communicate those ideas clearly, effectively and interestingly. An engaged reader will remember what s/he has read. If you fail to communicate effectively, your work will ultimately be of little use to the wider scientific community, resulting in lower uptake and fewer citations. Second, publishing is the currency of science and requires convincing Editors and Reviewers that your work is robust and meaningful. If your work is not well written, you cannot expect others to understand it. Reviewers can become bogged down in poor writing and sometimes assume that it is indicative of poor science. Reviewers sometimes return poorly written manuscripts directly to the Editor and refuse to review it. At best poor scientific writing leads to delays in the publication process, and at worst outright rejection. Third, writing clearly will improve your science. If your supervisors, co-authors, and collaborators understand your message and see that you have worked hard to provide a clearly written piece of work, they will provide far better input. If collaborators have to rewrite your work to understand it before they can comment on the content, you will frustrate them immensely and you will receive fewer quality comments about scientific direction and whether your paper hits the mark. In fact, writing well is valued by many collaborators and will lead to more collaborations. Last, writing well is a fundamental scientific skill (along with, for example, knowledge of the scientific method, quantitative skills, and discipline-specific technical skills), and we have a responsibility to write as well as we can out of respect for others, and to pass this knowledge on. With escalating pressures on academics, fewer of them are taking the time to help students with their writing skills. In the worst cases, supervisors and collaborators to pass on the task of language editing to the peer-review process. This is hugely counterproductive, and simply reinforces the cycle of deterioration in writing skills. Students and the academics who supervise them need to take responsibility in being part of the solution – improving scientific writing by passing on their knowledge to others. 5.1.3 Why do we have difficulties writing well? We all have to learn scientific writing – scientific English is no one’s first language! And it is even more difficult if English is not your mother tongue, especially for people who speak languages from outside Europe. So scientific writing does not come easily and requires hard work. Throughout our studies, we are not taught the concepts that are necessary for good writing. In many countries, the teaching of grammar at school is out of vogue. Scientific writing is also often not taught at university at the undergraduate levels. Nowadays, writing well is not a major learning outcome of most science courses, and assignments are marked predominantly on content and not readability and style. It is also easier to learn scientific writing during your postgraduate study when you can draw on your research, but many countries do not have coursework during postgraduate studies. Unfortunately, during this key developmental period, many supervisors often feel too busy to spend time to improve the writing of their students. Writing well also takes considerable time and effort. Writing well requires hard work rewriting many drafts, being self-critical of your own work, being afraid to make sometimes substantial changes, and opening up yourself to critique and potential criticism from others. For all these reasons, many scientists have trouble writing well. But scientific writing can be learned. 5.1.4 How this e-book can help This e-book, How to write well, provides what we think is best practice in terms of scientific writing and simple approaches to avoid common pitfalls. Often errors in writing are corrected or stylistic suggestions made by supervisors, reviewers or peers, without an explanation, primarily because of the people are time poor. This book is a result of seeing common mistakes by our students, and wanting to teach them how they can improve their writing. During our careers we have developed inherent knowledge about good scientific writing, and this e- book is an attempt to write this down into a coherent whole that is useful to others. Our approach is to identify a common problem, explain why it is a problem, illustrate it with examples, and show solutions. The content here is based on our experience, is by no means exhaustive, and others might have a different opinion. We are not English teachers or grammar Nazis (although Dave might be…?). We are merely practicing scientists interested in improving our own and others’ writing by sharing our experiences. Finally, this is part of a series of e-books that can help guide you through your scientific career. Often the best way to learn much of this information is to seek out a mentor. But it can be difficult to find a mentor with the insight, all-round skills, and the time available to provide advice. We have written this series of e- books to provide you with such a mentor – hopefully to provide the knowledge and guidance that you need in your career. This is the first e-book in the series. The second e-book is Writing a scientific paper. Early on in our careers we are ill-prepared for this challenge. Experienced scientists generally acquire the skills slowly and haphazardly through osmosis or from trial-and-error. Writing a paper thus often seems like a “dark art” – one that some scientists have mastered, but one that is hidden and rarely shared. The e- book Writing a scientific paper shines a light on the process of writing a scientific paper and helps you master it. The third e-book is Navigating the peer-review process. This often-overlooked part of the publication process involves understanding what different journals expect, what Editors and Reviewers look for, and how the peer-review process works. The e-book Navigating the peer-review process formalises our knowledge, experiences and opinions over the past 25 years of how we have gotten our work published. This e-book should will boost your chances of getting your work published, make it easier to get it published, reduce the time it takes to get it published, and help you formalise your own best practice. You can read these e-books in any order, and you can read their chapters in any order, dipping into the chapters most relevant to you. These books are targeted at early- and mid-career researchers, but will also provide insights for more experienced scientists. We would appreciate your feedback about what you found useful (or not) in the e-books, and what you would like to see covered in the future. Anthony J. Richardson and David S. Schoeman 5.2 General scientific style 5.2.1 Remove emotive language You should try and state the facts without using emotive terms include alarming, concerning, drastic, lovely, useless, wonderful and worringly. Especially in research focusing on conservation of habitats or iconic species, it is easy to use emotive language. If in doubt, think of the animal as a cockroach and see whether you would use the same language! Rather than: Following those alarming catch reductions, bans for manta ray fisheries were applied to some areas. Try: Following declining catches, bans for manta ray fisheries were applied to some areas. Or, stronger: Following precipitous declines in catches, bans for manta ray fisheries were applied to some areas. 5.2.2 Be consistent Reviewers and examiners often regard sloppiness and lack of attention in scientific writing as an indication of carelessness in your science. Some common examples include: - Use capitals for proper nouns everywhere - Whether you choose to use –ize or –ise, be consistent - Whether you choose to use a space (preferably) or not between numbers and their units, be consistent 5.2.3 Be particular! There are a bunch of things that are wrong and are just sloppy. Below are some examples, none of which is that important, but show a lack of care that can make the reader question how careful your science is. Rather than: La Nina/El Nino It is: La Niña/El Niño Rather than: Homo spp. It is: Homo spp. (Only the genus names is italicised). **** Rather than: m2 It is: m2 Rather than: www.lternet.edu It is: www.lternet.edu (Enables the Reader to use the hyperlink in a pdf). 5.2.4 Repetition is good! Scientific writing is different from writing novels. For example, in a novel an author might use different terms to identify the same thing to make it more interesting. However, in a scientific paper, repetition of the same term in makes it easier for the Reader to follow. 5.2.5 Elegant variation confuses… When there are multiple ways to say the same thing, one should not cycle through the different options for “elegant variation” because the use of a different word to a Reader can suggest something different is happening. For example, if a scientist is working on ‘copepods’, it is best to use this consistently throughout the paper, rather than referring to them variedly as ‘small crustaceans’, ‘zooplankton’, ‘maxillopodes’, ‘arthropods’, and ‘insects of the sea’, as the Reader will wonder if the author means different things by the different terms. In the following example, the Author has switched from using ‘measurement types’ and ‘ecological traits’ to ‘measurement attributes’ and ‘ecological characters’, making the Reader wonder if it is the same quantities being described. Rather than: Predictors were divided into two categories: measurement types and ecological traits. For measurement attributes we considered the frequency of sampling. For ecological characters we used a global database. Try: Predictors were divided into two categories: measurement types and ecological traits. For measurement types we considered the frequency of sampling. For ecological traits we used a global database. The following example uses ‘influenced’ and ‘described’ in similar contexts, leaving the Reader wondering whether the author meant to highlight such a difference. Rather than: While the abundance of pelagic fish is influenced by food availability and reproduction, their movement is described by oceanographic variables. Try: While the abundance of pelagic fish is influenced by food availability and reproduction, their movement is influenced by oceanographic variables. 5.2.6 Making word structure parallel… Repetition of structure in sentences and paragraphs, and even in headings, can make things easier to follow because it meets the expectations of a Reader. In the following example, the US is at the end of its part of the sentence and the UK is at the start. Rather than: …targeting the National Science Foundation in the US and the UK Natural Environment Research Council. Try: …targeting the US National Science Foundation and the UK Natural Environment Research Council. The specification of these three regions is not consistence amongst the parts of the sentence. Rather than: The northern region (10-25˚S) is characterised by warm tropical surface waters and a shallow mixed layer, subtropical waters form the central region (25-45˚S), and the most southern region (45-60˚S) verges on cooler subantarctic waters. Try: The northern region (10-24˚S) has warm tropical surface waters and a shallow mixed layer, the central region (24-45˚S) has subtropical and well mixed waters, and the southern region (45-50˚S) has cool subantarctic waters. 5.2.7 Be specific Rather than: Aggregations of reef manta rays Manta alfredi, such as those in the Maldives, Western Australia, and Komodo National Park in Indonesia are correlated with productivity. Try: Reef manta rays Manta alfredi in the Maldives, Western Australia, and in Indonesia aggregate in regions and at times when there is greater productivity. Rather than: The third version of the Receiving Water Quality Model, which is the version used in this study, resolved several limitations of the second version. Try: We used the third version of the Receiving Water Quality Model, which resolved several limitations of the second version, including X, Y and Z. Rather than: As a consequence, many diatoms exhibit a discontinuous seasonal occurrence that usually coincides with the introduction of nutrients such as during spring blooms. Try: Consequently, many diatoms peak during spring when nutrients and light are available. Rather than: etc. Try: Remove etc. from lists or precede it with “such as” or “including”, Why?: “etc.” is vague and everyone will think of different things. Using “such as” or “including” makes it clear you are only listing some of the options. 5.2.8 Be formal, not colloquial Scientific writing is a formal writing style and using colloquialisms are not appropriate. For example, using a phrase we might commonly use in everyday conversation such as “something is cool” is not appropriate (unless referring to temperature!). It might be more appropriate, however, in a scientific talk, to show you were excited about your results. Rather than: Like Try: Such as Rather than: My results were not very good/puzzling. Try: Results were unexpected/inaccurate/difficult to explain/non-intuitive/inconclusive/uninformative. Give reasons if possible. 5.2.9 Typeset equations properly If using Word, equations should be included using the Equation Editor, as numbers and variables are treated differently (e.g., variables are italicised) and the typesetting is clearer (e.g., for quotients). It is also better to have units in text rather than equation Rather than: MR (calories kg-1 day-1) = (68.9+177.8 * W) * 3.25 / (W * 24) Try: The equation for Metabolic Rate (𝑀𝑅, calories kg-1 d-1) as a function of Mass (𝑊, kg) is: MR = 3.5 × 68.9 + 177.8W / 24×𝑊 5.2.10 Make your writing more accessible: minimise acronyms Always spell them out the first time you use them Minimize their use as much as possible to make it easier for Readers. It is best not to use abbreviations if you use them &lt;5 times Best not to use them in headings Use capital letters The further apart the acronym needs to be used in the manuscript (e.g. Methods, Results, Discussion), the more times it needs to be used in the manuscript to warrant the use of the abbreviation Don’t use them in titles or figure legends 5.3 Simple words 5.3.1 Replace complex with simpler words Replacing more complex words with simpler (and usually shorter) words will make your writing more easily understood. Rather than Try ameliorate improve analogous similar anticipate expect approximately remove where possible, or use about, ~ or ca. biota species contradicts with contrasts with differential different employ use enumerate count facilitate help furthermore further magnitude size, extent, importance miniscule tiny, small numerous many, several obviate avoid/minimise orientate orient relatively equal similar semi-annually twice a year terminate stop, end, finish upon on utilise use 5.3.2 Simpler word groups: unstacking modifiers Stacking modifiers before a noun is the written equivalent of a traffic jam. Long noun strings save a word or two, but are awkward and confusing. Here is a bad one: “Space telescope wide-field planetary camera instrument definition team ground based charged-couple-device camera” (from New Scientist, cited by Matthew Lindsay Stevens in Subtleties of Scientific Style, 2007) Here is another example. Rather than: The availability of statistical correlative species distribution modelling algorithms has led to a rapid increase in their development. Try: The availability of algorithms for correlative species distribution modelling has led to a rapid increase in their development. Best: The availability of algorithms for correlative modelling of species’ distributions has led to their rapid development. Rather than: Thermal niche tracking in marine species Try: The tracking by marine species of their thermal niche Rather than: Marine species range edge shifts Try: Shifts in range edges of marine species Rather than: marine climate change impact studies Try: studies of the impacts of marine climate change 5.3.3 Redundant word pairs Be on the lookout for redundant word pairs, where one word implies the other. Examples: Small in size (small), rectangular in shape (rectangular), blue in colour (blue), tenuous in nature (tenuous), month of February (February), warming temperatures (warming), latitude 25°S (25°S) 5.4 Appropriate words 5.4.1 Appropriate adjectives Low and high and are over-used. Usually more-specific adjectives are more descriptive and interesting. High and low should really be confined to discussing height or elevation. Similarly, comparatives such as lower and higher are also used too often, and usually more specific comparatives are more apt. Rather than Try low (high)/lower (higher) abundance Small (large, big)/smaller (larger, bigger) low (high)/lower (higher) biodiversity poor (rich)/poorer (richer) low (high)/lower (higher) cost cheap (expensive)/cheaper (more expensive) cost low (high)/lower (higher) currents/forcing/stress/winds weak (strong)/weaker (stronger) low (high)/lower (higher) density/pitch/pressure/mountains/ relief low (high)/lower (higher) low (high)/lower (higher) mass light (heavy)/lighter (heavier) mass low (high)/lower (higher) distance short (long, far)/shorter (longer, further) low (high)/lower (higher) growth/photosynthetic/production/ speed rates slow (fast)/slower (faster) low (high)/lower (higher) gradients flat, weak (steep, strong)/flatter, weaker (steepr/stronger) low (high)/lower (higher) numbers few (many, several)/fewer (more, greater) number low (high)/lower (higher) amount small (larger)/smaller, lesser (larger, greater) low (high)/lower (higher) temperature cold, cool (warm, hot)/colder, cooler (warmer, hotter) temperature Rather than: Higher whale shark occurrence has been shown to correlate with La Niña conditions off Western Australia. Try: Whale sharks are more common during La Niña conditions off Western Australia. 5.4.2 Appropriate prepositions Rather than Try biased for biased toward. (e.g., Biased toward temperate latitudes) comparative to compared with in comparison to compared to compared with comparing between comparing correlated to correlated with different to different from in accordance to in accordance with in comparison to in comparison with insight to insight into similar as similar to spread in spread throughout targeted at targeted for 5.4.3 Appropriate word partners Using the appropriate word choice can be more powerful and comfortable, but also is sometimes needed to be correct. There are several examples below where the word “addressed” can be replaced with something more appropriate. Rather than Try There are many questions to be addressed. There are many questions to be answered There are many gaps to be addressed. There are many gaps to be filled. There are many problems to be addressed. There are many problems to be solved. There are many questions to be addressed. There are many questions to be answered. There are many challenges to solve There are many challenges to address /meet The goals to be addressed were: The goals to meet were: The issue arises The issue raised The question is raised The question arises a number of caveats were conceded a number of caveats Greater shifts in summer relative to winter Greater shifts in summer than winter Ranged from 0.008°C/y and 0.016°C/yr Ranged from 0.008°C/yr to 0.016°C/y The clear difference between oceanic and shelf break stations indicates that temperature influences chaetognath community structure, a premise that is strongly supported in other regions. The clear difference between oceanic and shelf break stations suggests that temperature influences chaetognath community structure, a premise that is strongly supported in other regions. Can something that is indicated be a premise? 5.5 Overused words We all have our different writing styles. However, sometimes we might use a word so frequently in our writing that it can grate on Readers, or a word is used without sufficient thought given to its meaning. 5.5.1 Occur “Occur” is often used too frequently. In one publication we commented on, the person used “occur/occurs/occurring/occurrence” 8 times in the Introduction, 11 times in the Methods, 44 times in the Results, and 49 times in the Discussion, and she was unaware she was over-using it. Here is an example from one paragraph: Rather than: Scenarios of moderate and strong upwelling were more likely to occur in the late upwelling season. Specifically, moderate upwelling occurred in January and February in seven of the eleven sampling events, while strong upwelling occurred in January, February and March in seven of the eight sampling events. A strong upwelling was recorded to occur only once in the early upwelling season (November 2015) during the study. Cold water (&lt;15 °C) never reached the surface for any sampling event during the study period. Highest φ values, indicative of stratification, occurred during moderate and strong upwelling, while φ values similar to those during winter and preconditioning occurred during suppression indicating a less stable water column and/or breakdown of stratification occurred during suppression. Try: Scenarios of moderate and strong upwelling were more likely in the late upwelling season. Specifically, there was moderate upwelling in January and February in seven of the eleven sampling events, while there was strong upwelling in January, February and March in seven of the eight sampling events. There was strong upwelling only once in the early upwelling season (November 2015). Cold water (&lt;15°C) never reached the surface for any sampling event during the study period. There were highest φ values, indicative of stratification, during moderate and strong upwelling, while φ values were similar to those during winter and preconditioning during suppression, indicating a less stable water column and/or breakdown of stratification. Rather than: For these management actions to occur, it is necessary to have strong and effective law enforcement. (Passive) Try: These management actions require strong and effective law enforcement. (Active) Rather than: We calculated mean annual phytoplankton biomass ( 〉 A , mmol.m- 3) for the top 50 m of each latitude band, which is where the greatest phytoplankton biomass typically occurs. Try: We calculated mean annual phytoplankton biomass ( 〉 A , mmol.m-3) for the top 50 m of each latitude band, where phytoplankton biomass is typically greatest. Rather than: Most invasions emerging from tropical regions occur before 2040. Try: Most invasions from tropical regions emerge before 2040. Rather than: The Central Indo-Pacific is an extreme example of a region where range contractions are projected to occur faster than expansions. Try: The Central Indo-Pacific is an extreme example of a region where faster range contractions than expansions are projected. Passive: Strong negative density-dependent regulation has been shown to occur at the critical recruitment stage. Active: There is strong negative density-dependent regulation at the critical recruitment stage. Passive: Coral bleaching has occurred in most regions Active: Coral has bleached in most regions. Active: Current evidence suggests range contractions seem to occur at significantly lower rates than expansions (refs). Passive: Range contractions are significantly slower than expansions (refs). Often “there are” can be used to remove “occur” Rather than: Anecdotal reports from dive centres along this coast indicate that whale shark aggregations occur at various locations between Zàvora and Bazaruto throughout the year. Try: Anecdotal reports from dive centres along this coast indicate that there are whale shark aggregations at various locations between Zàvora and Bazaruto throughout the year. Rather than: Remote connections occurring over longer time periods such as the Pacific Decadal Oscillation also affect the productivity of the region (Bakun and Broad, 2003). Try: Remote connections over longer time periods such as the Pacific Decadal Oscillation also affect the productivity of the region (Bakun and Broad, 2003). Rather than: It can occur that a single process such as recruitment may regulate a population if it is density-dependent in one instance, but limit a population if it is density-independent in another. Try: A single process such as recruitment may regulate a population if it is density-dependent in one instance, but limit a population if it is density- independent in another. 5.5.2 Important/crucial/critical The words “important”, “crucial” and “critical” are overused. If we say everything is important, crucial or critical, then they lose their impact and meaning. These words can be powerful when used sparingly and if the reasoning behind them is explained. If they are used multiple times in a paper, these words can often be removed with no ill effect. Valuable can often be used instead, but should also be followed by an explanation. Rather than: Salps are important members of the zooplankton community that have historically been ignored. Try: Salps are important in the global carbon cycle, but have historically been ignored. Rather than: E. radiata is a critical species in coastal ecosystems (Steneck et al., 2003). Try: E. radiata is a critical component of coastal ecosystems because it is a habitat-forming species that creates diverse niches for other species, as well as being highly productive and a preferred food source for a range of secondary consumers (Steneck et al., 2003). Rather than: Ecklonia communities are important because they play several major roles in coastal marine ecosystems (Hurd, 2000). Try: Ecklonia communities play several major roles in coastal marine ecosystems (Hurd, 2000). Rather than: It is important to identify the threats to flatback turtles while they are in their inter-nesting habitat around the Port of Gladstone so that points of conflict can be reduced, enabling the population to be more resilient (Witherington et al. 2008). Try: Identifying the threats to flatback turtles while they are in their inter- nesting habitat around the Port of Gladstone will allow points of conflict to be reduced, enabling the population to be more resilient (Witherington et al. 2008). Rather than: It is crucial that work such as this can be translated to on-ground decisions through open communication and collaboration among stakeholders in the region, thus ensuring sustainable development occurs that minimises the risk of negative outcomes for both biodiversity and livelihoods. Try: Similar work can be translated into on-ground decisions through open communication and collaboration among stakeholders in the region, thus ensuring sustainable development that minimises negative outcomes for both biodiversity and livelihoods. 5.5.3 Respectively Using ‘respectively’ in sentences can be needed, but often the sentence can be simplified to make it easier to read. Rather than: In the North Atlantic Ocean and north east Pacific albacore preferred respective temperatures between 10-17 ˚C and 11-23 ˚C, but individuals in the South Pacific (off the coast of American Samoa) have shown higher temperature preferences of 20-25 ˚C. Try: Pacific albacore prefer 10-17˚C water in the North Atlantic Ocean and 11- 23˚C water in the northeast Pacific, but warmer 20-25˚C waters in the South Pacific. 5.6 Confusing word pairs Here are some confusing word pairs and how to select the correct word. ‘A’ vs ‘an’ We know that ‘a’ is used before a word starting with a consonant, and ‘an’ is used before a word starting with a vowel. But, which sounds better? “An university degree” or “A university degree”? Here even though ‘university’ starts with a vowel, the ‘u’ makes the sound of the consonant ‘y’ (as in ‘yellow’) and thus sounds better with an ‘a’. So the rule that ‘an’ should precede words that start with a vowel is a generalization that does not cover all situations. An addendum to this rule is that ‘a’ should precede words where the first letter makes the sound of a consonant. Similarly, ‘an’ should precede words where the first letter makes the sound of a vowel. It is worth noting that some writers use “a hypothesis” and others use “an hypothesis”. We prefer using “a hypotheisis”. 5.6.1 ‘A’ rather than ‘an’ Rather than Try Why? An eucalyptus A eucalyptus ‘eu’ pronounced ‘y’ as in ‘yellow’ An euphemism A euphemism ‘eu’ pronounced ‘y’ An euphoric A euphoric ‘eu’ pronounced ‘y’ An European A European ‘eu’ pronounced ‘y’ An eutrophic A eutrophic ‘eu’ pronounced ‘y’ An one-hundred fold A one-hundred fold ‘o’ pronounced ‘w’ An SCUBA A SCUBA Because acronym is said rather than spelt An uniform A uniform ‘u’ pronounced ‘y’ An union A union ‘u’ pronounced ‘y’ An unilateral A unilateral ‘u’ pronounced ‘y’ An unique A unique ‘u’ pronounced ‘y’ An united A united ‘u’ pronounced ‘y’ An university A university ‘u’ pronounced ‘y’ An US A US ‘U’ sounds like ‘y’ An used A used ‘u’ pronounced ‘y’ An user-friendly A user-friendly ‘u’ pronounced ‘y’ An UV A UV ‘U’ sounds like ‘y’ 5.6.2 ‘An’ rather than ‘a’ Rather than Try Why? A heirloom An heirloom ‘h’ silent A honest An honest ‘h’ silent A honour/honourable An honour/honourable ‘h’ silent A hour An hour ‘h’ silent A x-ray An x-ray ‘x’ pronounced ‘e’ A x-chromosome An x-chromosome ‘x’ pronounced ‘e’ A FDA-approved An FDA-approved ‘F’ pronounced ‘e’ A LCD An LCD ‘L’ pronounced ‘e’ A MSc An MSc ‘M’ pronounced ‘e’ A RGB An RGB ‘R’ pronounced ‘ah’ A STD call An STD call ‘S’ pronounced ‘e’ 5.6.3 ‘Aims’ vs ‘objectives’ Although some authors use these interchangeably, careful writers distinguish them. Aims (and similarly goals) are general statements and are usually long- term or big picture. Objectives are specific, concrete statements that are often short-term, and can follow the SMART framework (Specific, Measurable, Accurate, Reasonable and Time-bound). Aims are often strategic in nature whereas objectives are more tactical. 5.6.4 ‘All together’ vs ‘Altogether’ ‘Altogether’ means ‘overall’ or ‘completely’. ‘All together’ pertains to a group and means ‘everyone’ or everything-together’. One way of assessing which to use is to test the sentence without the word ‘all’. If the sentence remains intact and comprehensible without ‘all’, it means the appropriate adverb is ‘all together’. If it no longer makes sense after ‘all’ has been removed, ‘altogether’ should be used. 5.6.5 Examples of ‘altogether’ Such barriers are generally weaker than those on land, subtly retarding movement in one direction or another rather than preventing it altogether (Gaines et al., 2007). The gemfish fishery, already under pressure from apparent over-fishing, collapsed altogether when the zonal winds declined to their low point in the 10-year cycle. In the interest of brevity, the suspect data have been removed from the paper altogether. Most of these estuaries have small river catchments and river flow is minimal or stops altogether for long periods at a time. For each of the three groups, two measures were analysed, giving six models altogether. 5.6.6 Examples of ‘all together’ Using the lattice package we can produce a histogram of gcsescore for each score, placing them all together on a single page All together, the papers documents the complete development process 5.6.7 ‘Between’ vs ‘Among’ Between for two things (e.g. between the goal posts) Among for three or more things (e.g. among the trees) 5.6.8 ‘Complement’ vs ‘Compliment’ ‘Complement’ means ‘something that completes or brings to perfection.’ A compliment is an expression of praise. Almost all scientific uses are ‘complement’. Example: Although he said that men and women have strengths that complement each other, she did not take this as a compliment. Rather than: This is a complimentary data set to the Australian Zooplankton Database available through the Australian Ocean Data Network portal. It is: This is a complementary data set to the Australian Zooplankton Database available through the Australian Ocean Data Network portal. ‘Comprise’/‘Consist of’/‘Composed of’ vs ‘Constitute’ “Comprise”, “consist of”, and “composed of” are synonymous and all mean “is made up of”. By contrast, constitute means “makes up” Example: The nucleus comprises protons and neutrons. Example: The nucleus consists of protons and neutrons. Example: The nucleus is composed of protons and neutrons. Example: Protons and neutrons constitute the nucleus. You could say that the parts ‘constitute’ the whole, and the whole ‘comprises’ or ‘consists of’ or is ‘composed of’ the parts. Note that you never say ‘composed of’. Rather than: Benthic crustaceans and molluscs comprise most of the fishery catch. Rather than: Benthic crustaceans and molluscs consists of most of the fishery catch. Rather than: Benthic crustaceans and molluscs composes most of the fishery catch. It is: Benthic crustaceans and molluscs constitute most of the fishery catch. It is: Most of the fishery catch comprises benthic crustaceans and molluscs. It is: Most of the fishery catch consists of benthic crustaceans and molluscs. It is: Most of the fishery catch is composed of benthic crustaceans and molluscs. Rather than: Each stock has a preferred latitudinal and depth range, comprising the species’ habitat. Rather than: Each stock has a preferred latitudinal and depth range, comprising the species’ habitat. It is: Each stock has a preferred latitudinal and depth range, constituting the species’ habitat. Sometimes it is neater to remove comprises/consists of/is composed completely. Rather than: Copepods comprised/consisted of/are composed of ~75% of the community by number. It is: Copepods constitute ~75% of the community by number. Best: Copepods are ~75% of the community by number. Rather than: Ecuador’s coastal and offshore waters comprises/consists of/is composed of part of the Humboldt Current. It is: Ecuador’s coastal and offshore waters constitutes part of the Humboldt Current. Best: Ecuador’s coastal and offshore waters are part of the Humboldt Current. 5.6.9 ‘Dependent’ vs ‘Dependant’ In UK English, ‘Dependant’ is the noun, and ‘dependent’ is the adjective. In scientific writing, almost all cases are ‘dependent’. This distinction is not made in US English; it uses ‘dependent’ in both instances. Rather than: The response of fish to climate change is dependant upon evolutionary history. It is: The response of fish to climate change is dependent upon evolutionary history. 5.6.10 ‘Effect’ vs ‘Affect’ ‘Effect’ and ‘affect’ are probably the two words that are regularly confused in scientific writing. ‘Affect’ is a verb meaning ‘to influence’. ‘Effect’ is usually a noun meaning result, but it can also (more rarely) be used as a verb meaning to cause. ‘Effect’ as a noun is followed by the preposition ‘on’ and preceded by an article (‘a’, ‘an’, ‘the’). Example: Temperature affects metabolic rates. (Affect is a verb). Example: Temperature has an effect on metabolism. (Common use of effect as a noun). Example: Temperature effects a change on metabolism. (Rarer use of effect as a verb). 5.6.11 ‘Either or’ vs ‘Neither nor’ These apply to no more than two items. Similarly, former and latter refer only to the first and second of only two items. 5.6.12 ‘Estimated’ vs ‘Measured’ vs ‘Quantified’ vs ‘Determined’ vs ‘Assessed’ These verbs all have somewhat similar meanings, but there are nuanced differences. They are generally not used interchangeably. It is worthwhile giving some thought to which is appropriate in different circumstances, but one should not cycle through the different options for “elegant variation” because the use of a different word to a Reader can suggest something different is happening. Although it is difficult to give hard-and-fast rules, and it can be slightly different depending on discipline, but here are some rules-of-thumb. 5.6.13 Measured Measured is used when a relatively simple instrument is used to make a measurement. Although in the following examples it is correct grammatically to use estimated, quantified, assessed, quantified or determined instead of measured, measured is more appropriate. Example: We measured the temperature of seawater using a thermometer. Example: We used an anemometer to measure wind strength and direction. 5.6.14 Estimated Estimated is less precise than measured. We often measure physical quantities and estimate biological quantities. Example 1: We estimated the density of fish using visual transects. Example 2: You estimate the density of copepods in the surface water 5.6.15 Assessed Assessed is generally used when testing a hypothesis, answering a question, or drawing conclusions from data. Example: We assessed whether the density of fish was related to habitat quality. 5.6.16 Quantified Quantified is typically used when you want to find a count, amount or a percentage of something. Example: We quantified the number of fish on the reef. 5.6.17 Determined Can be used when experimental values recorded by an instrument have to be processed to obtain the values. Example 1: We determined the chlorophyll concentations by measuring the fluorescence. Example 2: We determined that copepods stop feeding at food concentrations &lt;0.01 mg.m3 of chl-a. 5.6.18 ‘Led’ vs ‘Lead’ Mixing these two is a very common mistake in scientific writing. Led is the past tense and past participle of the verb to lead (rhymes with bead). Lead (rhymes with bead) is a noun referring to an initiative or a position at the front. Lead (rhymes with red) is also a noun referring to the metal. \"The Australian programme is led by the University of Queensland, which is also the lead institution in the International Consortium of Lead Research Institutions.\" 5.6.19 ‘Lesser’ vs ‘Fewer’ ‘Lesser’ refers to quantity, whereas ’fewer refers to number. 5.6.20 ‘Maybe’ vs ‘May be’ “Maybe” is an adverb and refers to a choice. “Maybe” means “perhaps” when used as an adverb and denotes a choice. A simple trick of finding out if you have used “maybe” in the right place is by interchanging “maybe” with “perhaps.” The sentence should refer to a choice and make sense. Rather than: The jellyfish collected by the Continuous Plankton Recorder are primarily epipelagic, but may be not neustonic. It is: The jellyfish collected by the Continuous Plankton Recorder are primarily epipelagic, but maybe not neustonic. Rather than: A decline of mud content in sediments took place over extensive areas, may be because of the removal of all mussel beds around 1990. It is: A decline of mud content in sediments took place over extensive areas, maybe because of the removal of all mussel beds around 1990. “May be” is a verb and refers to a possibility. The way to check if “may be” is correct, is to substitute “could be” or “would be” in its place. If it makes sense, the usage is correct. Rather than: It maybe difficult to separate from’ ‘Coelenterate tissue’’ if the bell is not found. It is: It may be difficult to separate from’ ‘Coelenterate tissue’’ if the bell is not found. Rather than: Generally, all individuals are counted, but for particularly dense samples a sub-sample maybe counted. It is: Generally, all individuals are counted, but for particularly dense samples a sub-sample may be counted. 5.6.21 ‘May’ vs ‘Might’ vs ‘Could’ Some journals prefer ‘might’ rather than ‘may’ because ‘may’ can have a connotation of permission. ‘Could’ is often stronger than ‘may’ or ‘might’ and thus is preferable sometimes. 5.6.22 ‘Past’ vs ‘Last’ There is not much difference, but careful writers prefer ‘past’. This is because ‘last’ can have the connotation of finality; there can be nothing after the last. It is thus preferable to use ‘past’ when referring to the period of time leading up to the present. 5.6.23 ‘Practice’ vs ‘Practise’ ‘Practice’ is a noun referring to the application of an idea (‘the practice of science’), the exercise of a profession (‘he left scientific practice’), customary procedure (‘it was common practice’), or repeated exercise or performance (‘knowing his times table required a lot of practice’) ‘Practise’ is a verb meaning to perform an activity or skill repeatedly to improve one's proficiency (‘He practised his dissection techniques’, or to observe or work at something (‘She practises science’) Example: You can practise your grammar at English Practice. Note that in US English, ‘practise’ is not used at all, only ‘practice’ for both meanings. If unsure, do what the Americans do and use practice! 5.6.24 Predominate vs Predominant Predominate is a verb. Predominant is the adjective; as an adverb, predominantly (not \"predominately\"). Example: Brown eye colour is the predominant trait Example: Brown eye colour predominates in humans. 5.6.25 ‘Principle’ vs ‘Principal’ ‘Principle’ is always a noun and is a ‘basic truth’ or ‘rule’ ‘Principal’ can be an adjective or a noun. As an adjective it means ‘most important’. As a noun it means an “administrator” or \"sum of money’. Note that when principal is used as a noun (e.g. principal of a school or the principal of a loan), it is the shortened form of a phrase (‘principal teacher’ or ‘principal sum’). Hint: A useful way to remember which one to use is: \"If you can substitute ‘main’ (which contains an ‘a’), use principal (which also contains an ‘a’). If you can substitute ‘rule’ (which ends in ‘le’), use principle (which also ends in ‘le’) (William and Mary Morris, Harper Dictionary of Contemporary Usage. Harper &amp; Row, 1975). “The principal reason that allometry is a scientific principle is principally that size governs the physiological, biological and ecological processes of plants and animals.” 5.6.26 Should vs Could Stating something “should” be done, rather than “could” be done, can be interpreted as too prescriptive and even a bit arrogant. It is usually better to say “could”. Rather than: Further studies should investigate vertical water column biomass structure as concentrated zooplankton prey densities may occur deeper at this site. Try: Further studies could investigate vertical water column biomass structure as concentrated zooplankton prey densities may occur deeper at this site 5.6.27 ‘Toward’ vs ‘Towards’ These are interchangeable. US and Canadian writers ‘towards’ and British and other English writers prefer ‘towards’. The same is true for ‘backwards/fowards’ and ‘backward/forward’ when used as adverb in the UK and US respectively. But when used as an adverb ‘Something is backward compatible’ or ‘She is forward- looking’, then it never has an ‘s’. 5.6.28 ‘Where’ vs ‘When’ Think about whether the sentence is talking about space or time. For example: Rather than: “Where M. birostris were observed with their cephalic fins firmly rolled up and not engaging in any other activity, behaviour was designated as cruising.” Try: “When M. birostris were observed with their cephalic fins firmly rolled up and not engaging in any other activity, behaviour was designated as cruising.” 5.6.29 ‘Which’ vs ‘That’ Distinguishing these two words can help to make intended relationships unmistakable, which is important in reporting scientific information. If the clause can be omitted without leaving the modified noun incomplete, use which and enclose the clause within commas or parentheses; otherwise, use that. Careful users of English distinguish the two. A ‘that’ should be used before a restrictive clause and ‘which’ before a non-restrictive clause. A restrictive clause is one that defines the situation and cannot be removed. A non-restrictive clause is separated by commas and is an additional piece of information that can be removed from the sentence without altering the meaning. For example, which of the following is correct: “Chickens that are well fed produce many eggs” “Chickens, which are well fed, produce many eggs” “Chickens which are well fed produce many eggs” The 1st one is correct, because only chickens that are well fed will produce many eggs. In the 2nd sentence, removing the ‘which are well fed’ separated by commas, leaves us with a sentence ‘Chickens produce many eggs’ that has a different meaning to the first sentence and is untrue (chickens produce no eggs when they are starving). In the 3rd sentence, it is better to replace the ‘which’ with ‘that’, as a clause with ‘which’ should be separated by commas and it is not then the restrictive clause that is needed here. Here is another example: “Copepods that are the world’s most abundant metazoans are ubiquitous.” “Copepods, which are the world’s most abundant metazoans, are ubiquitous.” “Copepods which are the world’s most abundant metazoans are ubiquitous.” Here the 2nd one is correct. The ‘which are the world’s most abundant metazoans’ is a non-restrictive clause, and removing this clause does not change the meaning of the sentence ‘Copepods are ubiquitous’. Although this might seem to be splitting hairs (or setae in the case of copepods!), it helps the Reader more easily follow your writing. 5.7 Punctuation 5.7.1 Apostrophes Apostrophes are used to show the omission of a letter or letters in a contraction, and to indicate possession. The possessive case causes the most problems. The following guidelines apply: Singular nouns are made possessive by adding an apostrophe and an ‘s’ at the end of them, even if they end in an ‘s’ or ‘ss’: The manta’s feeding area (the feeding area belongs to the manta) The student’s thesis (the thesis belongs to the student) The pus’s colour (the colour belongs to the pus) The moss’s growth (the growth belongs to the moss) Plural nouns (e.g. multiple animals) that end in ‘s’ (which is most plurals) are made possessive by adding an apostrophe without an ‘s’: The mantas’ feeding area (the feeding area belongs to multiple mantas). The fishes’ tank (the tank belongs to the fish) The students' theses (the theses belong to the students) Plural nouns that do not end in ‘s’ are made possessive by adding an apostrophe with an ‘s’: The people’s conference (the conference belonging to the people) The sheep’s brains (the brains belonging to the sheep) There is an exception to #1. If the singular and plural of a noun both end in an ‘s’, the possessive for both is then formed by adding an apostrophe only: The species’ status is endangered (the status belonging to species) Rabies’ cases were increasing (the cases belonging to rabies) In the case of a noun where both forms end in an ‘s’, it may be necessary to reword the sentence to clarify whether you are referring to a singular or plural noun: The status of the species was endangered. The status of the two species was endangered. When two or more nouns possess the same thing, add apostrophe ‘s’ to the last noun: Smith and Pauly’s paper (Smith and Pauly worked together on the same paper) When two or more nouns separately possess something, add apostrophe ‘s’ to each noun: Smith's and Pauly’s papers (Each person has their own paper) Do Not Use an Apostrophe with Possessive Pronouns. Possessive pronouns already show ownership (e.g. yours, his, hers, theirs). However, we do add an apostrophe ‘s’ to form the possessive of some indefinite pronouns (e.g. anybody's guess, one's personal responsibility, somebody's breakthrough) Do not use an apostrophe when the word desired is a plura. For example, it shodul be 1980s, not 1980’s. 5.7.2 Recommendations Apostrophes can be a bit of a minefield, and are often avoided in scientific writing. Here are some recommendations. 5.7.2.1 Minimize contractions. Contractions are used frequently in informal writing, but are rare in scientific writing Rather than: Isn’t Try: Is not Rather than: There’s Try: There is 5.7.2.2 Minimize apostrophes for possessives. Rather than: The manta’s underside is blotched Try: The underside of the manta is blotched 5.7.2.3 Never use an apostrophe to form a plural. Use an ‘s’ without an apostrophe to form plurals of nouns, including dates, acronyms, and family names (it is not possessive) Rather than: The mid-1980’s Try: The mid-1980s Rather than: Ecosystem Based Model’s (EBM’s) are common Try: Ecosystem Based Models (EBMs) are common 5.7.2.4 “It’s\" vs \"Its\". These are often confused.”It’s\" is common in colloquial writing and can be replaced by “it is” in scientific writing. “Its” is a personal pronoun. Rather than: It’s difficult to calculate its value Try: It is difficult to calculate its value 5.7.3 Commas Commas make your writing more readable and sometimes are essential for correct meaning. A comma is used to break up two clauses where a pause is needed between them. The pause can be used to introduce a new idea or to separate items in a list. A comma often helps to separate clauses that being with “but” or “with”, and at pauses at start of sentences, say after “Similarly,”. The following sentence is more readable with a comma after “reproduction”. Rather than: While the abundance of pelagic fish is influenced by food availability and reproduction their movement is influenced by oceanographic variables. Try: While the abundance of pelagic fish is influenced by food availability and reproduction, their movement is influenced by oceanographic variables. Similarly, a comma after “live weight” makes the following sentence clearer. Without the comma after “live weight”, you have to read the first sentence multiple times to understand its meaning. Rather than: As data were expressed in terms of live weight conversion factors were used again to determine the weight of consumable seafood in tonnes. Try: As data were expressed in terms of live weight, conversion factors were used to determine the weight of consumable seafood in tonnes. Often a comma is needed for clarity in a list when there are multiple “ands”. In the following, the comma after “flows” makes the list much easier to read. Rather than: The tidal range, flood and ebb flows and reef morphology create patterns in zooplankton accumulation and productivity around islands. Try: The tidal range, flood and ebb flows, and reef morphology create patterns in zooplankton accumulation and productivity around islands. Sometimes the meaning of a sentence can be changed entirely depending on if and where a comma is used. Version 1: While this hypothesis has not been formally tested, at least for Irukandji it appears to be fairly reliable. (The hypothesis has not been tested but appears to be reliable for Irukandji) Version 2: While this hypothesis has not been formally tested, at least for the Irukandji Carukia barnesi, it does appear to be fairly reliable. (The hypothesis has not been tested for Irukandji, but it appears reliable for other species) And one last example to illustrate that you can get yourself into real trouble with the (mis)-use of commas. This appeared in the Times, intended as a description of a Peter Ustinov documentary: Hmmm: Highlights of his global tour include encounters with Nelson Mandela, an 800-year-old demigod and a dildo collector. Do not omit commas before conjunctions in compound sentences. 5.7.4 Spaces Historically writers have used two spaces after a fullstop, but now the norm is to use one space. This is the standard in scientific journals. It also makes your work a bit shorter, which is always good. You can search for two spaces and replace with one space once ready to submit. Most journals use a space between numbers and units. Usually journals do not leave a space between the number and units of °C, %, °N, °S, °E, °W. 5.7.5 Hyphens Hyphening of compound or unit modifiers is often needed to clarify what is modifying what. For example, a small-grain harvest (harvest of small grain) is different from a small grain harvest (small harvest of all grain). A man eating fish is different from a man-eating fish! (see http://www.chem.ucla.edu/dept/Faculty/merchant/pdf/Word_Usage_Scientific_Writin g.pdf) 5.8 Short and simple sentences There is a tendency in scientific writing to have long, complex sentences, making it difficult for the Reader to follow. Your work will be cited more if you use shorter and more understandable sentences. If you need to have a long sentence, follow it with a short sentence to give the Reader a rest. One way of assessing how convoluted your writing is, is to use a Fog Index. Gunnings’s Fog Index is the best known and measures the level of reading difficulty of any document. It is an estimate of the education grade/year that a Reader would need to understand your work. It can be calculated at http://gunning-fog-index.com/index.html. Gunning’s Fog Index = \\[(average number of words per sentence) + (number of words of 3 syllables or more)\\] × 0.4 The Bible, Shakespeare and Mark Twain all have Fog Indexes of about 6. Time, Newsweek, and the Wall Street Journal average about 11. Scientific writing has higher Fog Indexes because of the nature of the content, but it is worth calculating yours for different pieces of work and try to reduce it. If your Fog Index soars then you might lose your readers in the fog! Microsoft Word calculates two other indexes for you. The Flesch Reading Ease Test is on a 100-point scale, with the higher the score the easier it is to read. The Flesch-Kincaid Grade Level Test rates text on a U.S. school grade level, similar to the Gunnings Fog Index, with a score of 7 meaning that a seventh grader can understand it. You can calculate these directly in your Word documents. In Windows, under Word ‘Options’, click ‘Proofing’, select ‘Check grammar with spelling’, and under ‘When correcting grammar in Word’ select ‘Show readability statistics check box’. For a Mac, go to Word ‘Preferences’, select ‘Spelling and Grammar’, and check ‘Show readability statistics’. When you then go through and use Tools Spelling and Grammar, Word will give you scores for the Flesch Reading Ease Test and the Flesch-Kincaid Grade Level Test. 5.8.1 Can you say something more simply? Make explicit statements Many scientists are reluctant to state facts explicitly, constantly couching expressions in vague terms. Maybe the logic is that if you are not making definitive statements then you can never be wrong. However, this means you end up saying very little, and what you do say confuses rather than informs. Remember words cost money for a journal (in terms of space) so be concise. A key skill in science is to be clear what we know and state those explicitly, and what we suspect/think and couch those more carefully. Many times, explicit statements are much clearer. Rather than: Some reef fish are known to farm algae, which shifts the benthos from a bare surface to an algal covered benthos. Try: Some reef fish farm algae, which shifts the seafloor from a bare surface to one covered by algae. Rather than: These organisms may require mechanisms of motility to access nutrients and preferred environmental conditions. Try: These organisms are motile so they can access nutrients and their preferred environmental conditions. Rather than: The possibility of vertical adjustment of species as a response to climate change has been shown at a large-scale for fish and invertebrate species in various parts of the ocean. Try: Fish and invertebrates can move deeper as oceans warm. In the next example, did the researchers “aim to investigate” the problem, or did they actually “investigate” the problem? Rather than: Here we aimed to investigate the interaction between whale shark feeding ecology and characteristics of the zooplankton community. Try: Here we investigated the relationship between whale shark feeding ecology and the zooplankton community. Rather than: There is very little difference of the impact of the different scenarios on evenness. Try: Different scenarios have similar evenness. Rather than: Targeted fisheries at aggregation sites can considerably affect population abundance of a species and can rapidly lead to local depletion. Try: Targeted fisheries at aggregation sites can deplete local populations. Rather than: There is strong evidence that trophic level has been shown to increase continuously with body size in plankton, benthic invertebrates and pelagic fish communities. Try: Trophic level increases with body size in plankton, benthic invertebrates and pelagic fish. Rather than: Climate velocity and connectivity tailored to capture the rates and directions of change in climate matching temporal windows of biological processes or life stages can therefore provide critically meaningful information for conservation. Try: Climate velocity and connectivity tailored to match temporal windows of biological processes or life stages can therefore provide meaningful information for conservation. An additional way to make your writing more concise is to remove ‘the’ before plurals. Rather than: The samples were collected… Try: Samples were collected… Rather than: Thermal niche tracking in marine species was shown in a previous study by Poloczanska et al., (2013) where from a meta-database (Marine Climate Change Impacts Database) containing 1,735 marine species’ responses, species exhibiting a shift typically moved at a rate consistent with sea-surface temperature changes. Try: Based on a meta-database containing 1,735 marine species’ responses, Poloczanska et al., (2013) showed that species tracked their thermal niche, moving at a rate consistent with sea surface temperature changes. 5.8.2 Uncertainties – only one in a sentence Multiple uncertainties in a sentence weaken your message and waste words. Rather than: It is possible that this optimum temperature may be too high for albacore in our region. Try: It is possible that this optimum temperature is too high for albacore in our region. Best: This optimum temperature could be too warm for albacore in our region. Rather than: We suggest that the majority of dietary intake for this species may be of mesopelagic origin. Try: We suggest that the majority of dietary intake for this species is of mesopelagic origin. Rather than: Reduction of residence time may suggest reduced viability of a protected area. Try: Reduction of residence time suggests reduced viability of a protected area. 5.8.3 Removing redundancy in sentences Sentences can often be made clearer and shorter by removing redundant and superfluous words. In the following sentence, the last clause “but this remains undemonstrated” is redundant, as it is implied by the third clause “has been hypothesized to cause illness”. Rather than: One species in the genus Carybdea, the Australian form of Carybdea xaymacana, has been hypothesised to cause illness, but this remains undemonstrated. Try: One species in the genus Carybdea, the Australian form of Carybdea xaymacana, has been hypothesised to cause illness. In the following example, there is no need to give coordinates when you refer to a map in a figure. Rather than: The region was subsetted into five discrete 5° latitudinal by 5° longitudinal cells for analyses (Figure 1). The five regions included the north- south latitudinal gradient with the following coordinates; region 1, 20°S to 25°S, 20°S, 155°E to 160°E; region 2, 25°S to 30°S, 155°E to 160°E; region 3, 30°S to 35°S, 155°E to 160°E; region 4, 35°S to 40°S, 152.5°E to 157.5°E; and region 5, 40°S to 45°S, 150°E to 155°E. Try: The region was subsetted into five 5° latitudinal by 5° longitudinal cells for analyses (Figure 1). In the next example, it is best not to refer back to previous sections of your work (e.g., as described/discussed/mentioned above, as described/discussed/mentioned previously), because it is vague, as you know exactly where, but your Readers do not. You should either assume people have read it or be more explicit about what you are referring to. The same goes for referring to something below. Rather than: As numerical techniques and accuracy evolved, models showed that kelp distribution was correlated with many of the other variables discussed above. Try: As numerical techniques and accuracy evolved, models showed that kelp distribution was correlated with X, Y and Z. Remove sentences that do not say much. Sometimes sentences do not say much and thus confuse the Reader and muddle your message. The examples below say very little and they are These are throw statements that you do not learn much from. Meaning? Although they concluded that further knowledge is needed regarding food web organization, … If 83% of the ocean is warming then this implies ocean temperatures are changing. Rather than: Approximately 83% of the area of the global ocean has warmed over the past half century (Burrows et al., 2011), as ocean temperatures change worldwide (Durack et al., 2014). Try: Approximately 83% of the area of the global ocean has warmed over the past half century (Burrows et al., 2011, Durack et al., 2014). 5.9 Effective sentences Sentences are the building blocks of any written piece. Knowing how to write well means getting your sentences right. 5.9.1 Agreement of subject and verb Singular subjects need singular verbs and plural subjects need plural verbs. This can be tricky when the subject is not immediately next to the verb, as in the following. In the following two examples, the subject of the sentence is singular (‘information’ and ‘number’) and not plural (‘parameters’ or ‘analyses’), so a singular verb (‘is’) is needed. Rather than: Information on basic biological parameters are essential. It is: Information on basic biological parameters is essential. Rather than: A number of supplementary analyses were conducted. It is: A number of supplementary analyses was conducted Here is one final example of a singular subject (‘distance’) needing a singular verb (‘is’). Rather than: The distance shifted at the leading and trailing edges are less prominent. It is: The distance shifted at the leading and trailing edges is less prominent And here is an example where the subject of the sentence is plural (‘distances’) and not singular (‘edge’), so a plural verb (‘are’) is needed. Rather than: Distances shifted at the leading and trailing edge is less prominent. It is: Distances shifted at the leading and trailing edge are less prominent. 5.9.2 Putting like things together Similar points should be closer together in a sentence or you risk. Here mercury and lead are not tissues but trace elements, so should go near trace elements. Rather than: Elasmobranchs accumulate trace elements in their tissues such as mercury and lead. Try: Elasmobranchs accumulate trace elements such as mercury and lead in their tissues 5.9.3 Active vs Passive voice There are two voices in English – active and passive. The active voice is often more direct, clearer and vivid, and is preferred for scientific writing and giving instructions. However, the passive voice is preferred when the subject of the sentence is implied, indefinite, general, unimportant, or if the writer is trying to increase vagueness or suspense. The passive voice often uses the word ‘by’ and is usually longer. The active voice often used personal pronouns (I, We, His, Her, Us). Historically, it has been frowned upon to use personal pronouns in scientific writing, perhaps because science should be independent of personal biases and detached from the researchers themselves. We are often taught in our undergraduate studies that using personal pronouns in scientific writing is anathema and many traditional scientists still reject it. In more recent years, however, there has been a push toward using the active rather than the passive voice in scientific writing because it is more direct and shorter. Our advice is to write in the active voice and use personal pronouns wherever you need to. Occasionally you will get an Editor who might not like it, but this is increasingly rare. If you do strike an Editor who does not like it, change it. Microsoft Word will highlight passive sentences and help you change them. Examples of passive vs active voice follow. Which voice do you prefer? ##Passive:## Gravity was discovered by Galileo. Here ‘Gravity’ is the subject, ‘Galileo’ is the object and ‘was discovered by’ is the verb. ##Active:## Galileo discovered gravity. Here ‘Galileo’ is the subject of the sentence, ‘gravity’ is the object and ‘discovered’ is the verb ##Passive 1:## An ecosystem model was constructed by us. Here ‘an ecosystem model’ is the subject, ‘us’ is the object, and ‘was constructed by’ is the verb. ##Passive 2:## An ecosystem model was constructed. As above, but the object “us” is implied. ##Active:## We constructed an ecosystem model. Here ‘We’ is the subject, ‘an ecosystem model’ is the object, and ‘constructed’ is the verb. ##Rather than##: Photosynthesis is regulated by light and nutrients. Try: Light and nutrients regulate photosynthesis. 5.9.4 Logical sequence It is usually best to use a logical sequence in a sentence, wherever possible. For example, in time (e.g., February before March), space (e.g., describe sites from North to South), phylogenetically (e.g., from simple to complex), or importance (e.g., human stresses on ecosystems that are most to least harmful). When this is not possible, alphabetical order is a good option. In the next example, transposing ‘weekly and daily’ makes more sense, as the sentence now goes from hourly, through daily, to weekly. Rather than: Hourly data were used for the case studies, while weekly and daily means were calculated for time-series analyses. Try: Hourly data were used for the case studies, while daily and weekly means were calculated for time-series analyses. 5.9.5 Numbers in sentences The general rule of writing numbers is that you spell out numbers less than 10 and write as a number those 10 or greater. There are a few extensions to this though. Never write numbers before units. Rather than: five m.s-1 It is: 5 m.s-1 When there are several numbers in a sentence and some are smaller and some are larger than 10, it is clearer for Readers to write them all as numbers. Rather than: The three lionesses had 10 cubs. Try: The 3 lionesses had 10 cubs. Some writers do not like starting a sentence with a number and prefer to spell it out, but it is usually neater to rewrite the sentence. Rather than: 50 samples were collected. Try: A total of 50 samples were collected. 5.9.6 One idea per sentence One idea per sentence makes it easier to follow, although two ideas can be linked if they are short and simple. Rather than: Occurring in all of the world’s oceans, diatoms are primarily comprised of rigid silica walls and are the first taxa to rapidly increase their abundance, or “bloom” following the introduction of nutrient-rich waters. Try: Diatoms have rigid silica walls and are found in all oceans. Diatoms are the first taxa to rapidly increase in abundance (“bloom”) following the introduction of nutrient-rich waters. 5.9.7 Lists in a sentence A standard way to have a list in a sentence is to start it with a colon, have semicolons between the items, and to use an ‘and’ after the last semicolon. It can be with or without numbers. Example: Assuming these trends in ocean warming are continued in the future, we hypothesise that: (1) pelagic fish species leading edges would shift further than their trailing edges; (2) shifts would be greater in winter than summer; and (3) shallower species would shift further south than deeper species. 5.10 Effective paragraphs 5.10.1 Structure Topic sentence and concluding sentences in paragraphs – not appropriate in fictional writing. The 1st sentence of a paragraph should summarize the paragraph. Thus if you want to skim a paper, you should be able to read the 1st sentence of each paragraph and follow the logic of the paper. This means that when writing a paragraph, keep in mind that it should give the overall message of the paragraph. Paragraphs should also not be too long. The longer the paragraph, the more difficult it is for the Reader to follow the message, and the more likely the Writer is to meander. Short, punchy paragraphs will best convey your messages. Here it is useful to separate the single long paragraph into two shorter paragraphs so the Reader does not get the impression that you are saying the same thing twice – it emphasises that one analysis is for Biomass and the other one is for Abundance. Rather than: Zooplankton biomass was significantly higher during manta ray feeding events than when manta rays were not feeding or were absent (ANOVA F(2,87)=11.41, p=3.98x10-5; Figure 4a). There was no significant difference in zooplankton biomass when manta rays were not feeding or were absent. Zooplankton was also significantly more abundant during feeding events than when manta rays were not feeding or were absent (ANOVA F2,47=11.48, p=8.69x10-5; Figure 4b). There was no significant difference in manta ray abundance when manta rays were not feeding or were absent. Try: Biomass of zooplankton (Figure 4a) was significantly higher during manta ray feeding events than when manta rays were not feeding (9.33 mg m-3, n=12; or were absent (ANOVA F(2,87)=11.41, p=3.98x10-5). There was no significant difference in zooplankton biomass when manta rays were not feeding or were absent. Abundance of zooplankton (Figure 4b) was also significantly higher during feeding events than when manta rays were not feeding or were absent (ANOVA F2,47=11.48, p=8.69x10-5). There was no significant difference in manta ray abundance when manta rays were not feeding or were absent 5.10.2 Lists The use of lists highlights a difference between writing in novels and scientific/technical writing. In a novel, there are never boring, repetitive lists that would lose Readers’ interest. In scientific and technical writing, however, lists are often vital for helping the Reader follow a complex argument or know all the different causes. Only use lists when there are three or more items: two items can just be explained one after the other and the Reader can easily follow. Lists are normally introduced with a sentence that states there are few/several/many explanations/reasons/steps for something. Rather than: Firstly, … Secondly, … Thirdly Try: Firstly, … Secondly, … Lastly Or best: First, … Second, … Last 5.11 Common grammatical mistakes 5.11.1 Remove double negatives Rather than: not over the limit. Try: below the limit. 5.11.2 Plurals Rather than: data is Try: data are Rather than: strata is Try: strata are 5.11.3 Split infinitives Rather than: estimations Try: estimates 5.11.4 However Better to place it more often within a sentence than at the beginning or end. “But” is better at the beginning. 5.11.5 Mainly “mainly had red females” OR “had mainly red females” A link between eddies, MLD and CHL … But: A link is technically only between 2 things 5.11.6 Using (reword, from the journal Conservation Biology.) In scientific writing, the word using is often the cause of dangling participles and misplaced modifiers. Rather than: Using tissue-isolation protocol, mtDNA was isolated from the dried skins. (Who is doing the using is unclear.) Try: We used tissue-isolation protocol to isolate mtDNA from the dried skins. Rather than: Ivory samples were taken from tusks using a 16-mm drill bit on a 40-cm drill. (This implies that the tusks used the drill) Try: We used a 16-mm drill bit on a 40-cm drill to take ivory samples from tusks. 5.11.7 Myself is not a substitute for me (Reword) “This paper has been reviewed by Dr. Smith and myself” and “The report enclosed was prepared by Dr. Jones and myself” are incorrect as is as is “Don’t hesitate to call Dr. Doe or myself”; me would have been correct in all instances. (Use of I also would have been wrong in those examples.) Some correct uses of myself: I found the error I myself saw it happen. I am not myself today. I cannot convince myself. I locked myself out of the car. 5.11.8 References and further reading Grammar http://www.differencebetween.net/ http://gunning-fog-index.com/index.html http://grammar.about.com/ 5.12 American English Differences 5.12.1 British or US English The Irish playwright Oscar Wilde described America and Britain as “two nations divided by the same language.” Many of the differences between US and British spelling were championed by the American teacher and lexicographer Noah Webster in the early 19th century. He saw the simplification of English spelling as a mark of American independence. Commonwealth nations generally follow British English. Although traditionally British journals have used British English and American journal American English, journals are usually flexible these days with whether you use British or US English. However, the most important advice is to be consistent in your usage. The best ways to do this are to be familiar with different forms, and to choose the English version on your spell checker in your word processor!

That means there are many computers all talking to each-other and sharing resources. The cluster will assign your job to nodes using the SLURM program. 6.1.2 Node Each computer in the cluster is called a node. Each node has it’s own cpu’s, memory and graphics card. Nodes all share a common network drive, so all your data is available on all the nodes. 6.1.3 Cores and memory Most nodes in Getafix have about 24 cores, a few have more and a few have less. Each node also typically has about 250GB of memory. If I can find a list of the nodes, I’ll add it for reference. 6.1.4 Login Node One node is special, the login node. Strictly speaking, Getafix is the login node, which is why Dogmatix, the older SMP cluster, has access to most of the same resources and nodes. The login node works like any remote computer, you can run jobs on the login node, but out of respect for other users, you should only do setup operations and short tests on the login node. 6.1.5 SLURM SLURM is the program that balances all the jobs between users across the cluster. You specify what you want the cluster to do, and how much time, nodes, cpu’s and memory you think you will need. SLURM then waits until the cluster has enough resources available to run your job and starts the job. If you try to use more resources than you asked for, your job will be killed. If you ask for lots of resources, it might take a while for enough nodes to be available, since smaller jobs will usually fill up the available resources as other jobs end. 6.1.6 Other Resources The cluster has access to shared resources, particularly shared storage and networking, so your data is available on all the nodes at the same location. 6.2 Getting into Getafix 6.2.1 Request Access Email ITS at help@its.uq.edu.au and request access to the SMP cluster which is called Getafix. This can take a few days. Make sure you explain your connection to the School of Maths and Physics. For HDR students, you will often have both a staff and student account. Let ITS know which one you want to use to log in with. 6.2.2 Network Access You must be on the UQ intranet to access the servers. 6.2.3 eduroam/uq cable/uq wifi You are already in the intranet. 6.2.3.1 Everywhere else You will need to install the UQ VPN software and log in. Follow the instructions at: https://my.uq.edu.au/information-and-services/information-technology/working-remotely/vpn-virtual-private-network 6.2.4 The terminal To access Getafix, you will need a terminal program on your computer. On mac, this is Terminal. On windows, this is Command Prompt or Windows Powershell (not Windows Powershell ISE). If you don’t have an up to date Windows 10 machine, install PuTTy. Some people like the Ubuntu app in windows 10, just remember the mnt/c syntax to get to the files on your computer. 6.2.5 Logging into Getafix Once you have your terminal open, type: ssh &lt;username&gt;@getafix.smp.uq.edu.au Where &lt;username&gt; is your staff or student login. If a popup appears saying \"Authenticity can't be established\". Say yes. Enter your password. If you see: &gt; ssh: Could not resolve hostname getafix.smp.uq.edu.au: This is usually &gt; a temporary error during hostname resolution and means that the local &gt; server did not receive a response from an authoritative server. Then you either typed it incorrectly or are not on the UQ internal network, see Network Access. If you really want R X11 plots to appear on your desktop, add -X to the login. This works on Mac and Linux. Windows may need an X11 server, which you can most easily get from the Ubuntu app. I strongly recommend saving plots into files and copying them to your computer, X11 can be very slow to render. ssh -X &lt;username&gt;@getafix.smp.uq.edu.au 6.2.5.1 Advanced SSH config file \\~/.ssh/config: Host my-getafix ForwardX11Trusted yes #equivalent to adding -X User uqpdyer HostName 130.102.3.59 Host dogmatix ForwardX11Trusted yes User uqpdyer HostName dogmatix.smp.uq.edu.au Now, you only have to type ssh my-getafix 6.2.6 Putting your data on Getafix You need to have your data on Getafix. Where to put it? ls / 6.2.6.1 Home /home/username/ Which is often shortened to ~/ You have 40GB of data allowed in here. The home directory is often used for programs and configuration files. R libraries will install here by default, which is fine. Don’t use the home directory for data sets, results and plots. 6.2.6.2 Data /data/username/ You have 400GB of data allowed in here. Put your data sets and scripts in the /data/username/ directory. At some point we may have a shared folder in here, probably /data/mathmarecol/. 6.2.6.3 Data1, Data2 … Data6 Most of the time you use /data/ but there are other data folders that you can access on request. /data1/username/ /data2/username/ data1 and data2 are older system drives that we are not using. data3 to data6 are high speed access drives for very large file reading and writing. These could be useful for work on GCM’s. 6.2.7 Sending your data to getafix 6.2.7.1 scp scp is copy over ssh, it should work anywhere ssh works. scp -r local_folder &lt;username&gt;@getafix.smp.uq.edu.au:/data/&lt;username&gt;/&lt;folder&gt; 6.2.7.2 WinSCP A graphical interface for scp. 6.2.7.3 rsync Rsync is smarter than scp, it only copies changes, so it can be faster than scp. usually installed on Linux, may not be available on Mac or Windows. rsync local_folder &lt;username&gt;@getafix.smp.uq.edu.au:/data/&lt;username&gt;/&lt;folder&gt; 6.3 Running jobs on Getafix 6.3.1 Modules To allow different versions of software to be used by different users (like python 3.4 versus python 3.6), Getafix uses Linux modules. On Getafix, R is in a module, and won’t work until you load the module. You can use the default version of a module, or specify a particular version of a module if your job depends on it. To see what modules are available, type: module avail When you see a module you want to use, load it with: module load &lt;module name&gt; I use the following modules: module load R module load pandoc #rendering rmarkdown into html and pdf module load gdal #spatial packages like sf module load geos #spatial packages like sf module load proj #spatial packages like sf 6.3.2 R on Getafix R on Getafix is pretty similar to R on your local computer, without RStudio. # ### installing packages Install packages to a local library in your home directory. module load R R install.packages(&quot;foreach&quot;) install.packages(&quot;doParallel&quot;) install.packages(&quot;sf&quot;) Accept the default library location unless you have a reason not to. If your package fails to install, check if there is a system package missing. For example, to install sf, you need to load more modules: module load R module load gdal module load geos module load proj R Now sf should install. install.packages(&quot;sf&quot;) If it still does not work, send an email to help@its.uq.edu.au, they have been helpful setting me up when something was missing or broken. 6.3.3 Parameters for Rmd files You can pass parameters into Rmd files from the command line. You need to set up the `params` in the YAML header, see https://bookdown.org/yihui/rmarkdown/parameterized-reports.html Using Rscript, you can render a report using a specified set of parameters like this: paramlist=&#39;list(nCores =24, gRange = 1:300 )&#39; Rscript -e &#39;knitr::opts_knit$set(progress = TRUE, verbose = TRUE); rmarkdown::render(&quot;/data/uqpdyer/demo.Rmd&quot;, params = &#39;&quot;${paramlist}&quot;&#39;, output_format = &quot;html_notebook&quot;, output_file = &quot;outfile.html&quot;, output_dir = &quot;/data/uqpdyer&quot;, envir = new.env())&#39; This is not as convenient as setting parameters in RStudio or within an R session. You have to be very careful about quotes, and the command line is hard to edit. Sending parameters to an R script in bulk is much easier, but lacks the reproducability of Rmd. 6.3.3.1 Parameters for script files Use the base commandArgs or the optparse package to use command line parameters in your script files Then you can run the script from the command line like this: Rscript script.R input1 input2 6.3.4 SLURM So far, R has been running on the login node. Some things are easiest to do on the login node, like installing packages and transferring files. Computationally heavy tasks should be done on other nodes. To use the other nodes, you submit jobs with SLURM. SLURM is a job scheduler. People request jobs by specifying the resources they need and the scripts to run, and SLURM queues the jobs until some nodes are available to run the job. You can also request an interactive session, but it is more efficient to set up jobs and come back to get the results. 6.3.4.1 sbatch The command sbatch is used to submit jobs, which are run when the resources become available. You use SLURM by calling sbatch: sbatch script.sh where script.sh looks like #!/bin/bash #SBATCH --ntasks=1 #SBATCH --cpus-per-task=1 #SBATCH --mem-per-cpu=1G #SBATCH --time=0-00:10 echo &quot;hello world&quot; The #SBATCH lines at the top are parameters for the sbatch command, you can also include them in the command call: sbatch script.sh --ntasks=1 --cpus-per-task=1 --mem-per-cpu=1G --time=0-00:10 script.sh Then script.sh can simplify down to: #!/bin/bash echo &quot;hello world&quot; When working with R, we run scripts or arbitrary code snippets with Rscript, but the sbatch command still expects Rscript to be wrapped in script_for_r.sh #!/bin/bash #SBATCH --ntasks=1 #SBATCH --cpus-per-task=20 #SBATCH --mem-per-cpu=2G #SBATCH --time=0-01:00 module load R Rscript myRscript.R So running sbatch looks the same: sbatch script_for_r.sh Here is a meaningful r script we can test out. Note that I have specified 20 cpu’s in both script_for_r.sh and myRscript.R library(foreach) library(doParallel) cl &lt;- makeCluster(2) registerDoParallel(cl) x &lt;- iris[which(iris[,5] != &quot;setosa&quot;), c(1,5)] trials &lt;- 10000 ptime &lt;- system.time({ r &lt;- ~foreach~(icount(trials), .combine=cbind) %dopar% { ind &lt;- sample(100, 100, replace=TRUE) result1 &lt;- glm(x[ind,2]~x[ind,1], family=binomial(logit)) coefficients(result1) } })[3] ptime stime &lt;- system.time({ r &lt;- ~foreach~(icount(trials), .combine=cbind) %do% { ind &lt;- sample(100, 100, replace=TRUE) result1 &lt;- glm(x[ind,2]~x[ind,1], family=binomial(logit)) coefficients(result1) } })[3] stime stopCluster(cl) cl &lt;- makeCluster(20) registerDoParallel(cl) ptime &lt;- system.time({ r &lt;- ~foreach~(icount(trials), .combine=cbind) %dopar% { ind &lt;- sample(100, 100, replace=TRUE) result1 &lt;- glm(x[ind,2]~x[ind,1], family=binomial(logit)) coefficients(result1) } })[3] ptime 6.3.4.2 salloc and srun If you really need to run something interactively, such as a Matlab GUI, make sure you log in with -X or -Y and then call: salloc --ntasks=1 --cpus-per-task=1 --mem-per-cpu=1G --time=0-00:10 srun --pty -x11 matlab 6.3.4.3 Many nodes So far, we have used only 1 node. The memory and cpu’s are all in the same node, and R behaves in exactly the same way as on your machine, only with more cores. You are clearly limited to a speed up of around 20 times with a single node. To go beyond the single node limit, you have a few options. Divide your job up If you can break your job up into many independent runs, then you can submit a job for each run, and collect all the different outputs after all the jobs have run. I have done this to test out the effects of changing combinations of parameters. Rslurm The Rslurm package will generate a set of scripts that submit a collection of jobs. Rslurm does the work of dividing up your job for you. Take care with this package, the default settings will allocate far too many jobs and overwhelm Getafix. MPI Message Passing Interface (MPI) is a library that shares information across nodes. MPI requires extra setup in your code, and you need to use mpirun or srun inside the sbatch script #!/bin/bash #SBATCH --ntasks=1 #SBATCH --cpus-per-task=1 #SBATCH --mem-per-cpu=1G #SBATCH --time=0-00:10 mpirun echo &quot;running with MPI&quot; srun echo &quot;run with SRUN&quot; doMPI and Rmpi are packages for working with MPI in R. TODO: I have not figured out MPI on the cluster yet, it didn’t “just work” future.batchTools The future.batchtools package lets you submit SLURM jobs from R. The benefit of using future.batchtools is that you write R code using future syntax, then specify a SLURM plan, and all futures at a level specified by the plan are sent off as jobs. The script waits until the job finishes. I recommend running a single node task with 1 cpu and a modest amount of ram, but a long running time, then all the heavy lifting is done by new jobs submitted by your script. Take care with this package, I haven’t checked the defaults, but it might request too many resources like Rslurm. 6.3.4.4 R with parameters Being able to pass in parameters is useful for dividing your job up. Some examples of sbatch scripts that use R parameters #!/bin/bash #SBATCH --ntasks=1 #SBATCH --cpus-per-task=24 #SBATCH --mem-per-cpu=7G #SBATCH --time=1-22:00 module load R Rscript script.R $1 $2 sbatch run_script.sh input1 input2 sbatch run_script.sh input1 input3 $1 becomes the first argument, input1 both times, and $2 becomes the second argument, input2 in the first run and input3 in the second line. Rendering an Rmd file with parameters: #!/bin/bash #SBATCH --ntasks=1 #SBATCH --cpus-per-task=24 #SBATCH --mem-per-cpu=7G #SBATCH --time=1-22:00 module load R module load pandoc #essential for knitr and rmarkdown paramlist=&#39;list(nCores =24, gRange = 1:300 )&#39; Rscript -e &#39;knitr::opts_knit$set(progress = TRUE, verbose = TRUE); rmarkdown::render(&quot;/data/uqpdyer/demo.Rmd&quot;, params = &#39;&quot;${paramlist}&quot;&#39;, output_format = &quot;html_notebook&quot;, output_file = &quot;outfile.html&quot;, output_dir = &quot;/data/uqpdyer&quot;, envir = new.env())&#39; If you want to generate a collection of rendered Rmd files, you have to write up a script for each set of parameters. The other way to generate a set of Rmd files with different parameters, in parallel, is to copy the file and change the parameters in each file. Then you can use job arrays by naming the files from 1 to n. The simplest approach I can think of to run many different Rmd files is to have a shell script, that calls an R script, that renders an Rmd. Parameters passed to the shell script go all the way down to the Rmd file. args = commandArgs(trailingOnly = TRUE) knitr::opts_knit$set(progress = TRUE, verbose = TRUE) paramlist=list(nCores =as.numeric(args[1]), gRange = as.numeric(args[2]):as.numeric(args[3])) rmarkdown::render(&quot;/data/uqpdyer/demo.Rmd&quot;, params = paramlist, output_format = &quot;html_notebook&quot;, output_file = &quot;outfile.html&quot;, output_dir = &quot;/data/uqpdyer&quot;, envir = new.env()) 6.4 Debugging Rmd files Debugging regular R isn’t great, but debugging Rmd files non-interactively is even worse. Here are some tricks: 6.4.1 Cache on Turn on caching for your Rmd file. knitr::opts_chunk$set(cache=TRUE) 6.4.2 Load in cache dir The qwraps2 package on github has a function, lazyload_cache, which will pull in the saved cache so you can interact with it in RStudio. https://github.com/dewittpe/qwraps2/blob/master/R/lazyload_cache.R Once you call lazyload_cache() on the cache generated by knitr, your environment has all the variables seen up until a failure point. 6.5 Getting Results back The batch jobs are not interactive. You set them up to run and come back for the results. Usually you save a file to disk. 6.5.1 Printed text All printed output goes to a file slurm-&lt;job number&gt;.out. You can change the name with #!/bin/bash #SBATCH -o output_file_%A_%a.out #%A is the job number, %a is the array number #SBATCH -e error_file.err 6.5.2 Data.frames If you have R objects you want to see, save them to disk. saveRDS R binary format, single object, you specify the name when you readRDS fwrite data.table csv writer, fast, and gives you a csv feather a new binary format backed by Hadley, fast, and compatible with python fst another new binary format, extremely fast and you can read in subsets of the data.frame Archivist puts everything into a database and gives a unique hash to every object. Good for reproducibility, you can’t mix up objects from different runs later on because the hash always changes 6.5.3 Plots Always save plots to disk, unless you are using Rmd files, which will put the plot into the output html anyway. Use ggsave() for ggplots, and dev.png(), your plotting code, dev.off() for other kinds of R plots. It is a good idea to set the width, height and dpi for all your plots. 6.6 Playing nice The cluster is a shared resource. Try to be as precise as possible when allocating resources, so others can use what you don’t need. Be careful with any package that submits jobs for you (Rslurm,future.batchtools). Check the jobs are requesting a reasonable set of resources. 6.6.1 Parallel coding in R 6.6.1.1 parlapply, par*apply etc. The parallel package gives you par* versions of the apply family of functions. Easy to drop in if you usually use the apply family from base R, you replace any apply, lapply, sapply with parapply, parlapply, parsapply. 6.6.1.2 foreach and %dopar% The foreach package has a few uses. First, it changes how you use for loops in R. Base R for loops usually work by changing a variable defined outside the loop. foreach is more like an apply, where a result is returned, so foreach works without needing to use side effects. Second, because foreach can work without side effects, it can run the loop in parallel easily. There are a number of backends you can use, including doParallel, doMPI, doFuture. You can quickly change how parallel works by replacing %do% with %dopar% and changing the registerDo* function at the start of your script. If you already like using foreach over the apply family, moving to parallel is easy. The main downside is that foreach is not particularly efficient with resources. If you are mostly using the apply family, switching to foreach is much harder. 6.6.1.3 future The future package is built around the idea of a promise. The promise is “Eventually the variable will have a result assigned to it, but not straight away”. You replace &lt;- with %&lt;-% and the line of code becomes a promise, rather than something to do right away. Generally, you don’t need to change your code much, just add % around your &lt;- at strategic points, but you can gain a lot of flexibility, and there are many backends. future.apply gives you parallel versions of apply. doFuture mixes future and foreach. future.batchtools spawns jobs on the cluster that return the results into your session. future.callr does local parallel calculations in separate R processes. future alone will do local multiprocessor calculations and use multiple nodes. 6.6.1.4 General Coding habits for going parallel Put things into lists It is easy to loop over lists, and you can quickly parallelise the processing of a list. Don’t do graphics in parallel Generally speaking, you can specify ggplot objects in parallel, but if you try to print or save them in parallel, R crashes. You probably have to work very carefully to open multiple dev.png() for plotting base R plots. Make functions small If you repeat something frequently, put it into a function. You can then put functions into packages. Try to keep functions small, then they are easier to use in parallel. Generally don’t try to work in parallel within a function. If you want a function to use parallel processing, I strongly recommend you use either future or foreach with %dopar%. By default, they both drop back to sequential processing, but the user can set up parallel processing before calling the function to get speed improvements. Look for loops, but don’t use R base for loops Base R for loops cannot be used in parallel, because they rely on side effects. 6.7 Tricks Don’t forget which computer you are looking at "],

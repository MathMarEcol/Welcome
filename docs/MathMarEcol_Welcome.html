<p>Welcome to the Mathematical Marine Ecology Lab.</p>
<p>This book has been put together as the main source of information for all members of the MME Lab. It includes info on lab meetings, administration, data-storage, open data-science, R programming, writing skills and GitHub.</p>
<div id="lab-meetings" class="section level2">
<h2><span class="header-section-number">1.1</span> Lab Meetings</h2>
<p>The MME lab meets up every fortnight in the on Level 5 of the Queenland Bioscience Precinct. We generally use this as an opportunity to catch up on what everyone is doing, and share tips and tricks around data, programming and open data-science. Each meeting, one person is nominated to lead a discussion on a specific topic. Contact Anthony to be added to the email list. You can also attend virtually.</p>

<div id="open-data-science" class="section level2">
<h2><span class="header-section-number">1.4</span> Open Data Science</h2>
<p>While we have always made our data and code available to those who have asked, in 2019 the MME Lab has decided to adopt a full open data-science model. We attended the wonderful Data Science Training (<a href="http://ohi-science.org/data-science-training/" class="uri">http://ohi-science.org/data-science-training/</a>) run by the <em>The Ocean Health Index Team</em>. We acknowledge all the help and resources they have made available which has allowed us to get up and running so quickly.</p>
<p>Many sections of this book introduce open data science so we can work with data in an open, reproducible, and collaborative way. Open data science means that methods, data, and code are available so that others can access, reuse, and build from it without much fuss. Here we demonstrate a workflow with R, RStudio, Git, and GitHub, as described in <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41559-017-0160">Lowndes <em>et al. 2017, Nature Ecology &amp; Evolution</em>: Our path to better science in less time using open data science tools</a>.</p>
</div>
<div id="online-code-of-conduct" class="section level2">
<h2><span class="header-section-number">1.5</span> Online Code of Conduct</h2>
<p>We have adopted the code of conduct from Mozilla to govern participation in all online communities associated with the MME Lab, including GitHub, Gitter, GoogleDocs, email and lab meetings.
As part of this we must always:
- Be respectful and value each other’s ideas, styles and viewpoints.
- Be direct but professional; we cannot withhold hard truths.
- Be inclusive and help new perspectives be heard.
- Be open to learning from others.
- Lead by example and match your actions with your words.</p>
<p>For a full description of the Community Participation Guidelines see: <a href="https://www.mozilla.org/en-US/about/governance/policies/participation/" class="uri">https://www.mozilla.org/en-US/about/governance/policies/participation/</a></p>

<p>We will be using data and packages that are installed with R (often called “Base R”).</p>

<h2><span class="header-section-number">2.2</span> Why learn R with RStudio</h2>
<p>You are all here today to learn how to code. Coding made me a better scientist because I was able to think more clearly about analyses, and become more efficient in doing so. Data scientists are creating tools that make coding more intuitive for new coders like us, and there is a wealth of awesome instruction and resources available to learn more and get help.</p>
<p>Here is an analogy to start us off. <strong>Think of yourself as a pilot, and R is your airplane.</strong> You can use R to go places! With practice you’ll gain skills and confidence; you can fly further distances and get through tricky situations. You will become an awesome pilot and can fly your plane anywhere.</p>
<p>And <strong>if R were an airplane, RStudio is the airport</strong>. RStudio provides support! Runways, communication, community, and other services that makes your life as a pilot much easier. So it’s not only the infrastructure (the user interface or IDE), although it is a great way to learn and interact with your variables, files, and interact directly with GitHub. It’s also a data science philosophy, R packages, community, and more. So although you can fly your plane without an airport and we could learn R without RStudio, that’s not what we’re going to do.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>We are learning R together with RStudio and its many supporting features.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Something else to start us off is to mention that you are learning a new language here. It’s an ongoing process, it takes time, you’ll make mistakes, it can be frustrating, but it will be overwhelmingly awesome in the long run. We all speak at least one language; it’s a similar process, really. And no matter how fluent you are, you’ll always be learning, you’ll be trying things in new contexts, learning words that mean the same as others, etc, just like everybody else. And just like any form of communication, there will be miscommunications that can be frustrating, but hands down we are all better off because of it.</p>
<p>While language is a familiar concept, programming languages are in a different context from spoken languages, but you will get to know this context with time. For example: you have a concept that there is a first meal of the day, and there is a name for that: in English it’s “breakfast”. So if you’re learning Spanish, you could expect there is a word for this concept of a first meal. (And you’d be right: ‘desayuno’). <strong>We will get you to expect that programming languages also have words (called functions in R) for concepts as well</strong>. You’ll soon expect that there is a way to order values numerically. Or alphabetically. Or search for patterns in text. Or calculate the median. Or reorganize columns to rows. Or subset exactly what you want. We will get you increase your expectations and learn to ask and find what you’re looking for.</p>

<div id="r-at-the-console-rstudio-goodies" class="section level2">
<h2><span class="header-section-number">2.3</span> R at the console, RStudio goodies</h2>
<p>Launch RStudio/R.</p>
<p><img src="img/RStudio_IDE.png" /></p>
<p>Notice the default panes:</p>
<ul>
<li>Console (entire left)</li>
<li>Environment/History (tabbed in upper right)</li>
<li>Files/Plots/Packages/Help (tabbed in lower right)</li>
</ul>
<p>FYI: you can change the default location of the panes, among many other things: <a href="https://support.rstudio.com/hc/en-us/articles/200549016-Customizing-RStudio">Customizing RStudio</a>.</p>
<p>An important first question: <strong>where are we?</strong></p>
<p>If you’ve have opened RStudio for the first time, you’ll be in your Home directory. This is noted by the <code>~/</code> at the top of the console. You can see too that the Files pane in the lower right shows what is in the Home directory where you are. You can navigate around within that Files pane and explore, but note that you won’t change where you are: even as you click through you’ll still be Home: <code>~/</code>.</p>
<p><img src="img/RStudio_IDE_homedir.png" /></p>
<p>OK let’s go into the Console, where we interact with the live R process.</p>
<p>Make an assignment and then inspect the object you created by typing its name on its own.</p>
<pre class="sourceCode r"><code class="sourceCode r">x &lt;-<span class="st"> </span><span class="dv">3</span> <span class="op">*</span><span class="st"> </span><span class="dv">4</span>
x</code></pre>
<pre><code>## [1] 12</code></pre>
<p>In my head I hear, e.g., “x gets 12”.</p>
<p>All R statements where you create objects – “assignments” – have this form: <code>objectName &lt;- value</code>.</p>
<p>I’ll write it in the console with a hashtag <code>#</code>, which is the way R comments so it won’t be evaluated.</p>
<pre class="sourceCode r"><code class="sourceCode r"><span class="co">## objectName &lt;- value</span>

<span class="co">## This is also how you write notes in your code to explain what you are doing.</span></code></pre>
<p>Object names cannot start with a digit and cannot contain certain other characters such as a comma or a space. You will be wise to adopt a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Snake_case">convention for demarcating words</a> in names.</p>
<pre class="sourceCode r"><code class="sourceCode r"><span class="co"># i_use_snake_case</span>
<span class="co"># other.people.use.periods</span>
<span class="co"># evenOthersUseCamelCase</span></code></pre>
<p>Make an assignment</p>
<pre class="sourceCode r"><code class="sourceCode r">this_is_a_really_long_name &lt;-<span class="st"> </span><span class="fl">2.5</span></code></pre>
<p>To inspect this variable, instead of typing it, we can press the up arrow key and call your command history, with the most recent commands first. Let’s do that, and then delete the assignment:</p>
<pre class="sourceCode r"><code class="sourceCode r">this_is_a_really_long_name</code></pre>
<pre><code>## [1] 2.5</code></pre>
<p>Another way to inspect this variable is to begin typing <code>this_</code>…and RStudio will automagically have suggested completions for you that you can select by hitting the tab key, then press return.</p>
<p>One more:</p>
<pre class="sourceCode r"><code class="sourceCode r">science_rocks &lt;-<span class="st"> &quot;yes it does!&quot;</span></code></pre>
<p>You can see that we can assign an object to be a word, not a number. In R, this is called a “string”, and R knows it’s a word and not a number because it has quotes <code>" "</code>. You can work with strings in your data in R pretty easily, thanks to the <a href="http://stringr.tidyverse.org/"><code>stringr</code></a> and <a href="https://github.com/juliasilge/tidytext#tidytext-text-mining-using-dplyr-ggplot2-and-other-tidy-tools"><code>tidytext</code></a> packages. We won’t talk about strings very much specifically, but know that R can handle text, and it can work with text and numbers together (this is a huge benefit of using R).</p>
<p>Let’s try to inspect:</p>
<pre class="sourceCode r"><code class="sourceCode r">sciencerocks
<span class="co"># Error: object &#39;sciencerocks&#39; not found</span></code></pre>
<div id="error-messages-are-your-friends" class="section level3">
<h3><span class="header-section-number">2.3.1</span> Error messages are your friends</h3>
<p>Implicit contract with the computer / scripting language: Computer will do tedious computation for you. In return, you will be completely precise in your instructions. Typos matter. Case matters. Pay attention to how you type.</p>
<p>Remember that this is a language, not unsimilar to English! There are times you aren’t understood – it’s going to happen. There are different ways this can happen. Sometimes you’ll get an error. This is like someone saying ‘What?’ or ‘Pardon’? Error messages can also be more useful, like when they say ‘I didn’t understand what you said, I was expecting you to say blah’. That is a great type of error message. Error messages are your friend. Google them (copy-and-paste!) to figure out what they mean.</p>
<img src="img/practicalDev_googleErrorMessage.jpg" width="400"/>
<p>And also know that there are errors that can creep in more subtly, when you are giving information that is understood, but not in the way you meant. Like if I am telling a story about suspenders that my British friend hears but silently interprets in a very different way (true story). This can leave me thinking I’ve gotten something across that the listener (or R) might silently interpreted very differently. And as I continue telling my story you get more and more confused… Clear communication is critical when you code: write clean, well documented code and check your work as you go to minimize these circumstances!</p>

<div id="logical-operators-and-expressions" class="section level3">
<h3><span class="header-section-number">2.3.2</span> Logical operators and expressions</h3>

<p>Shortcuts
You will make lots of assignments and the operator <code>&lt;-</code> is a pain to type. Don’t be lazy and use <code>=</code>, although it would work, because it will just sow confusion later. Instead, utilize <strong>RStudio’s keyboard shortcut: Alt + - (the minus sign)</strong>.
Notice that RStudio automagically surrounds <code>&lt;-</code> with spaces, which demonstrates a useful code formatting practice. Code is miserable to read on a good day. Give your eyes a break and use spaces.
RStudio offers many handy <a href="https://support.rstudio.com/hc/en-us/articles/200711853-Keyboard-Shortcuts">keyboard shortcuts</a>. Also, Alt+Shift+K brings up a keyboard shortcut reference card.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>My most common shortcuts include command-Z (undo), and combinations of arrow keys in combination with shift/option/command (moving quickly up, down, sideways, with or without highlighting.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>When assigning a value to an object, R does not print anything. You can force R to print the value by using parentheses or by typing the object name:</p>
<pre class="sourceCode r"><code class="sourceCode r">weight_kg &lt;-<span class="st"> </span><span class="dv">55</span>    <span class="co"># doesn&#39;t print anything</span>
(weight_kg &lt;-<span class="st"> </span><span class="dv">55</span>)  <span class="co"># but putting parenthesis around the call prints the value of `weight_kg`</span></code></pre>
<pre><code>## [1] 55</code></pre>
<pre class="sourceCode r"><code class="sourceCode r">weight_kg          <span class="co"># and so does typing the name of the object</span></code></pre>
<pre><code>## [1] 55</code></pre>
<p>Now that R has <code>weight_kg</code> in memory, we can do arithmetic with it. For
instance, we may want to convert this weight into pounds (weight in pounds is 2.2 times the weight in kg):</p>
<pre class="sourceCode r"><code class="sourceCode r">weight_kg <span class="op">*</span><span class="st"> </span><span class="fl">2.2</span></code></pre>
<pre><code>## [1] 121</code></pre>
<p>We can also change a variable’s value by assigning it a new one:</p>
<pre class="sourceCode r"><code class="sourceCode r">weight_kg &lt;-<span class="st"> </span><span class="fl">57.5</span>
weight_kg <span class="op">*</span><span class="st"> </span><span class="fl">2.2</span></code></pre>
<pre><code>## [1] 126.5</code></pre>
<p>And when we multiply it by 2.2, the outcome is based on the value currently assigned to the variable.</p>
<p>OK, let’s store the animal’s weight in pounds in a new variable, <code>weight_lb</code>:</p>
<pre class="sourceCode r"><code class="sourceCode r">weight_lb &lt;-<span class="st"> </span>weight_kg <span class="op">*</span><span class="st"> </span><span class="fl">2.2</span></code></pre>
<p>and then change <code>weight_kg</code> to 100.</p>
<pre class="sourceCode r"><code class="sourceCode r">weight_kg &lt;-<span class="st"> </span><span class="dv">100</span></code></pre>
<p>What do you think is the current content of the object <code>weight_lb</code>? 126.5 or 220? Why?
It’s 125.6. Why? Because assigning a value to one variable does not change the values of
other variables — if you want <code>weight_kg</code> updated to reflect the new value for <code>weight_lb</code>, you will have to re-execute that code. This is why we re-comment working in scripts and documents rather than the Console, and will introduce those concepts shortly and work there for the rest of the day.</p>
<p>We can create a vector of multiple values using <code>c()</code>.</p>
<pre class="sourceCode r"><code class="sourceCode r"><span class="kw">c</span>(weight_lb, weight_kg)</code></pre>
<pre><code>## [1] 126.5 100.0</code></pre>
<pre class="sourceCode r"><code class="sourceCode r">names &lt;-<span class="st"> </span><span class="kw">c</span>(<span class="st">&quot;Jamie&quot;</span>, <span class="st">&quot;Melanie&quot;</span>, <span class="st">&quot;Julie&quot;</span>)

<div id="r-functions-help-pages" class="section level2">
<h2><span class="header-section-number">2.5</span> R functions, help pages</h2>
<p>R has a mind-blowing collection of built-in functions that are used with the same syntax: function name with parentheses around what the function needs to do what it is supposed to do. <code>function_name(argument1 = value1, argument2 = value2, ...)</code>. When you see this syntax, we say we are “calling the function”.</p>
<p>Let’s try using <code>seq()</code> which makes regular sequences of numbers and, while we’re at it, demo more helpful features of RStudio.</p>
<p>Type <code>se</code> and hit TAB. A pop up shows you possible completions. Specify <code>seq()</code> by typing more to disambiguate or using the up/down arrows to select. Notice the floating tool-tip-type help that pops up, reminding you of a function’s arguments. If you want even more help, press F1 as directed to get the full documentation in the help tab of the lower right pane.</p>
<p>Type the arguments <code>1, 10</code> and hit return.</p>
<pre class="sourceCode r"><code class="sourceCode r"><span class="kw">seq</span>(<span class="dv">1</span>, <span class="dv">10</span>)</code></pre>
<pre><code>##  [1]  1  2  3  4  5  6  7  8  9 10</code></pre>
<p>We could probably infer that the <code>seq()</code> function makes a sequence, but let’s learn for sure. Type (and you can autocomplete) and let’s explore the help page:</p>
<pre class="sourceCode r"><code class="sourceCode r">?seq 
<span class="kw">help</span>(seq) <span class="co"># same as ?seq</span></code></pre>
<p>The help page tells the name of the package in the top left, and broken down into sections:</p>
<ul>
<li>Description: An extended description of what the function does.</li>
<li>Usage: The arguments of the function and their default values.</li>
<li>Arguments: An explanation of the data each argument is expecting.</li>
<li>Details: Any important details to be aware of.</li>
<li>Value: The data the function returns.</li>
<li>See Also: Any related functions you might find useful.</li>
<li>Examples: Some examples for how to use the function.</li>
</ul>
<pre class="sourceCode r"><code class="sourceCode r"><span class="kw">seq</span>(<span class="dt">from =</span> <span class="dv">1</span>, <span class="dt">to =</span> <span class="dv">10</span>) <span class="co"># same as seq(1, 10); R assumes by position</span></code></pre>
<pre><code>##  [1]  1  2  3  4  5  6  7  8  9 10</code></pre>
<pre class="sourceCode r"><code class="sourceCode r"><span class="kw">seq</span>(<span class="dt">from =</span> <span class="dv">1</span>, <span class="dt">to =</span> <span class="dv">10</span>, <span class="dt">by =</span> <span class="dv">2</span>)</code></pre>
<pre><code>## [1] 1 3 5 7 9</code></pre>
<p>The above also demonstrates something about how R resolves function arguments. You can always specify in <code>name = value</code> form. But if you do not, R attempts to resolve by position. So above, it is assumed that we want a sequence <code>from = 1</code> that goes <code>to = 10</code>. Since we didn’t specify step size, the default value of <code>by</code> in the function definition is used, which ends up being 1 in this case. For functions I call often, I might use this resolve by position for the first
argument or maybe the first two. After that, I always use <code>name = value</code>.</p>
<p>The examples from the help pages can be copy-pasted into the console for you to understand what’s going on. Remember we were talking about expecting there to be a function for something you want to do? Let’s try it.</p>
<div id="your-turn-1" class="section level3">
<h3><span class="header-section-number">2.5.1</span> Your turn</h3>
<blockquote>
<p>Exercise: Talk to your neighbor(s) and look up the help file for a function that you know or expect to exist. Here are some ideas: <code>?getwd()</code>, <code>?plot()</code>, <code>min()</code>, <code>max()</code>, <code>?mean()</code>, <code>?log()</code>).</p>
</blockquote>
<p>And there’s also help for when you only sort of remember the function name: double-question mark:</p>
<pre class="sourceCode r"><code class="sourceCode r">??install </code></pre>
<p>Not all functions have (or require) arguments:</p>
<pre class="sourceCode r"><code class="sourceCode r"><span class="kw">date</span>()</code></pre>
<pre><code>## [1] &quot;Mon Jul 22 20:19:57 2019&quot;</code></pre>
</div>
</div>
<div id="packages" class="section level2">
<h2><span class="header-section-number">2.6</span> Packages</h2>
<p>So far we’ve been using a couple functions from base R, such as <code>seq()</code> and <code>date()</code>. But, one of the amazing things about R is that a vast user community is always creating new functions and packages that expand R’s capabilities. In R, the fundamental unit of shareable code is the package. A package bundles together code, data, documentation, and tests, and is easy to share with others. They increase the power of R by improving existing base R functionalities, or by adding new ones.</p>
<p>The traditional place to download packages is from CRAN, the <a href="https://cran.r-project.org/">Comprehensive R Archive Network</a>, which is where you downloaded R. You can also install packages from GitHub, which we’ll do tomorrow.</p>
<p>You don’t need to go to CRAN’s website to install packages, this can be accomplished within R using the command <code>install.packages("package-name-in-quotes")</code>. Let’s install a small, fun package <code>praise</code>. You need to use quotes around the package name.:</p>
<pre><code>install.packages(&quot;praise&quot;)</code></pre>
<p>Now we’ve installed the package, but we need to tell R that we are going to use the functions within the <code>praise</code> package. We do this by using the function <code>library()</code>.</p>
<p><strong>What’s the difference between a package and a library?</strong><br />
Sometimes there is a confusion between a package and a library, and you can find people calling “libraries” to packages.</p>
<p>Please don’t get confused: <code>library()</code> is the command used to load a package, and it refers to the place where the package is contained, usually a folder on your computer, while a package is the collection of functions bundled conveniently.</p>
<pre class="sourceCode r"><code class="sourceCode r"><span class="kw">library</span>(praise)</code></pre>
<p>Now that we’ve loaded the <code>praise</code> package, we can use the single function in the package, <code>praise()</code>, which returns a randomized praise to make you feel better.</p>
<pre class="sourceCode r"><code class="sourceCode r"><span class="kw">praise</span>()</code></pre>

<p>Now look at the objects in your environment (workspace) – in the upper right pane. The workspace is where user-defined objects accumulate.</p>
<p><img src="img/RStudio_IDE_env.png" /></p>
<p>You can also get a listing of these objects with a few different R commands:</p>

<p>If you want to remove the object named <code>weight_kg</code>, you can do this:</p>
<pre class="sourceCode r"><code class="sourceCode r"><span class="kw">rm</span>(weight_kg)</code></pre>
<p>To remove everything:</p>
<pre class="sourceCode r"><code class="sourceCode r"><span class="kw">rm</span>(<span class="dt">list =</span> <span class="kw">ls</span>())</code></pre>
<p>or click the broom in RStudio’s Environment pane.</p>
<p>For reproducibility, it is critical that you delete your objects and restart your R session frequently. You don’t want your whole analysis to only work in whatever way you’ve been working right now — you need it to work next week, after you upgrade your operating system, etc. Restarting your R session will help you identify and account for anything you need for your analysis.</p>

<p>This is also going to introduce us to the fact that RStudio is a sophisticated text editor (among all the other awesome things).

<img src="img/rstudio_new-rmd-doc-html.png" width="300"/>
<p>You can give it a Title like “My Project”. Then click OK.</p>
<p>OK, first off: by opening a file, we are seeing the 4th pane of the RStudio console, which is essentially a text editor. This lets us organize our files within RStudio instead of having a bunch of different windows open.</p>
<p>Let’s have a look at this file — it’s not blank; there is some initial text is already provided for you. Notice a few things about it:</p>
<ul>
<li>There are white and grey sections. R code is in grey sections, and other text is in white.</li>
</ul>
<p><img src="img/rmarkdown.png" /></p>
<p><br></p>
<p>Let’s go ahead and “Knit HTML” by clicking the blue yarn at the top of the RMarkdown file.</p>
<p><br></p>
<p><img src="img/rmarkdown_side_by_side.png" /></p>
<p>What do you notice between the two? So much of learning to code is looking for patterns.</p>
<p>Notice how the grey <strong>R code chunks</strong> are surrounded by 3 backticks and <code>{r LABEL}</code>. These are evaluated and return the output text in the case of <code>summary(cars)</code> and the output plot in the case of <code>plot(pressure)</code>.</p>
<p>Notice how the code <code>plot(pressure)</code> is not shown in the HTML output because of the R code chunk option <code>echo=FALSE</code>.</p>
<p>The hashtag (#) at lines 12 and 22 cause the following text to be displayed larger and in bold.</p>
<p>This RMarkdown file has 2 different languages within it: <strong>R</strong> and <strong>Markdown</strong>.</p>
<p>We don’t know that much R yet, but you can see that we are taking a summary of some data called ‘cars’, and then plotting. We will focus on R for the rest of the workshop, but for the rest of this morning let’s focus on the second language.</p>
<p>The second language is Markdown. This is a formatting language for plain text, and there are only about 15 rules to know.</p>
<p>Notice the syntax for:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>headers</strong> get rendered at multiple levels: <code>#</code>, <code>##</code></li>
<li><strong>bold</strong>: <code>**word**</code></li>
</ul>
<p>There are some good <a href="https://github.com/adam-p/markdown-here/wiki/Markdown-Here-Cheatsheet">cheatsheets</a> to get you started, and here is one built into RStudio: Go to Help &gt; Markdown Quick Reference
<br />
<br /></p>
<p><strong>Important</strong>: note that the hashtag <code>#</code> is used differently in Markdown and in R:</p>
<ul>
<li>in R, a hashtag indicates a comment that will not be evaluated. You can use as many as you want: <code>#</code> is equivalent to <code>######</code>. It’s a matter of style. I use two <code>##</code> to indicate a comment so that it’s clearer what is a comment versus what I don’t want to run at the moment.</li>
<li>in Markdown, a hashtag indicates a level of a header. And the number you use matters: <code>#</code> is a “level one header”, meaning the biggest font and the top of the hierarchy. <code>###</code> is a level three header, and will show up nested below the <code>#</code> and <code>##</code> headers.</li>
</ul>
<p>If this seems confusing, take comfort in the fact that you are already used to using <code>#</code>s differently in real life: it can mean “number” or “pound” or hashtags on social media.</p>

<h3><span class="header-section-number">2.8.2</span> Code chunks</h3>
<p>OK. Now let’s practice with some of those commands that we were working on this morning.</p>
<p>Create a new chunk in your RMarkdown first in one of these ways:</p>
<ul>
<li>click “Insert &gt; R” at the top of the editor pane</li>
<li>type by hand

<p>Now, let’s write some R code.</p>
<pre><code>x &lt;- seq(1:15)</code></pre>
<p>Now, hitting return does not execute this command; remember, it’s a text file in the text editor, it’s not associated with the R engine. To execute it, we need to get what we typed in the the R chunk (the grey R code) down into the console. How do we do it? There are several ways (let’s do each of them):</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li>copy-paste this line into the console.</li>

<h2><span class="header-section-number">3.2</span> Analysis plan</h2>
<p>OK, here is the plan for our analysis. We want to plot the gdpPercap for each country in the gapminder data frame. So that’s 142 separate plots! We will automate this, labeling each one with its name and saving it in a folder called figures. We will learn a bunch of things as we go.</p>

<div id="create-an-r-script" class="section level2">
<h2><span class="header-section-number">3.3</span> Create an R script</h2>
<p>OK, now, we are going to create an R script. What is an R script? It’s a text file with a .R extension. We’ve been writing R code in R Markdown files so far; R scripts are just R code without the Markdown along with it.</p>
<p>Go to File &gt; New File &gt; R Script (or click the green plus in the top left corner).</p>
<p>Let’s start off with a few comments so that we know what it is for, and save it:</p>
<pre><code>## gapminder-analysis.R
## analysis with gapminder data
## J Lowndes lowndes@nceas.ucsb.edu</code></pre>
<p>We’ll be working with the gapminder data again so let’s read it in here:</p>

<p>Remember, like in R Markdown, hitting return does not execute this command. To execute it, we need to get what we typed in the script down into the console. Here is how we can do that:</p>

<h2><span class="header-section-number">3.4</span> Automation with for loops</h2>
<p>Our plan is to plot gdpPercap for each country. This means that we want to do the same operation (plotting gdpPercap) on a bunch of different things (countries). Yesterday we learned the dplyr’s <code>group_by()</code> function, and this is super powerful to automate through groups. But there are things that you may not want to do with <code>group_by()</code>, like plotting. So we will use a for loop.</p>
<p>Let’s start off with what this would look like for just one country. I’m going to demonstrate with Afghanistan:</p>
<!---TODO
For the figures, we want it to label the currency, which we have in another data file (=join). And, we'll want to add Westeros to the dataframe (=rbind) and create that figure too.

<p>Let’s actually give this a better title than just the country name. Let’s use the <code>base::paste()</code> function from to paste two strings together so that the title is more descriptive. Use <code>?paste</code> to see what the “sep” variable does.</p>

<div id="thinking-ahead-cleaning-up-our-code" class="section level3">
<h3><span class="header-section-number">3.4.1</span> Thinking ahead: cleaning up our code</h3>
<p>Now, in our code above, we’ve had to write out “Afghanistan” several times. This makes it not only typo-prone as we type it each time, but if we wanted to plot another country, we’d have to write that in 3 places too. It is not setting us up for an easy time in our future, and thinking ahead in programming is something to keep in mind.</p>
<p>Instead of having “Afghanistan” written 3 times, let’s instead create an object that we will assign to “Afghanistan”. We won’t name our object “country” because that’s a column header with gapminder, and will just confuse us. Let’s make it distinctive: let’s write cntry (country without vowels):</p>
<pre class="sourceCode r"><code class="sourceCode r"><span class="co">## create country variable</span>
cntry &lt;-<span class="st"> &quot;Afghanistan&quot;</span></code></pre>
<p>Now, we can replace each <code>"Afghanistan"</code> with our variable <code>cntry</code>. We will have to introduce a <code>paste</code> statement here too, and we want to separate by nothing (<code>""</code>). Note: there are many ways to create the filename, and we are doing it this way for a specific reason right now.</p>
<pre class="sourceCode r"><code class="sourceCode r"><span class="co">## create country variable</span>

<p>Let’s run this. Great! it saved our figure (I can tell this because the timestamp in the Files pane has updated!)</p>
</div>
<div id="for-loop-basic-structure" class="section level3">
<h3><span class="header-section-number">3.4.2</span> For loop basic structure</h3>
<p>Now, how about if we want to plot not only Afghanistan, but other countries as well? There wasn’t actually that much code needed to get us here, but we definitely do not want to copy this for every country. Even if we copy-pasted and switched out the country assigned to the <code>cntry</code> variable, it would be very typo-prone. Plus, what if you wanted to instead plot lifeExp? You’d have to remember to change it each time…it gets messy quick.</p>
<p>Better with a for loop. This will let us cycle through and do what we want to each thing in turn. If you want to iterate over a set of values, and perform the same operation on each, a <code>for</code> loop will do the job.</p>
<p><strong>Sit back and watch me for a few minutes while we develop the for loop.</strong> Then we’ll give you time to do this on your computers as well.</p>
<p>The basic structure of a <code>for</code> loop is:</p>
<pre class="sourceCode r"><code class="sourceCode r"><span class="cf">for</span>( each item <span class="cf">in</span> set of items ){
  do a thing
}</code></pre>
<p>Note the <code>( )</code> and the <code>{ }</code>. We talk about iterating through each item in the for loop, which makes each item an iterator.</p>
<p>So looking back at our Afghanistan code: all of this is pretty much the “do a thing” part. And we can see that there are only a few places that are specific to Afghanistan. If we could make those places not specific to Afghanistan, we would be set.</p>
<p><img src="img/for_loop_logic.png" /></p>
<p>Let’s paste from what we had before, and modify it. I’m also going to use RStudio’s indentation help to indent the lines within the for loop by highlighting the code in this chunk and going to Code &gt; Reindent Lines (shortcut: command I)</p>
<pre class="sourceCode r"><code class="sourceCode r"><span class="co">## create country variable</span>

}</code></pre>
</div>
<div id="executable-for-loop" class="section level3">
<h3><span class="header-section-number">3.4.3</span> Executable for loop!</h3>
<p>OK. So let’s start with the beginning of the for loop. We want a list of countries that we will iterate through. We can do that by adding this code before the for loop.</p>
<pre class="sourceCode r"><code class="sourceCode r"><span class="co">## create a list of countries</span>
country_list &lt;-<span class="st"> </span><span class="kw">c</span>(<span class="st">&quot;Albania&quot;</span>, <span class="st">&quot;Fiji&quot;</span>, <span class="st">&quot;Spain&quot;</span>)

<span class="cf">for</span> ( cntry <span class="cf">in</span> country_list ) {
  
  <span class="co">## filter the country to plot</span>
  gap_to_plot &lt;-<span class="st"> </span>gapminder <span class="op">%&gt;%</span>
<span class="st">    </span><span class="kw">filter</span>(country <span class="op">==</span><span class="st"> </span>cntry)
  
  <span class="co">## plot</span>
  my_plot &lt;-<span class="st"> </span><span class="kw">ggplot</span>(<span class="dt">data =</span> gap_to_plot, <span class="kw">aes</span>(<span class="dt">x =</span> year, <span class="dt">y =</span> gdpPercap)) <span class="op">+</span><span class="st"> </span>
<span class="st">    </span><span class="kw">geom_point</span>() <span class="op">+</span>

<span class="st">    </span><span class="kw">labs</span>(<span class="dt">title =</span> <span class="kw">paste</span>(cntry, <span class="st">&quot;GDP per capita&quot;</span>, <span class="dt">sep =</span> <span class="st">&quot; &quot;</span>))
  
  <span class="kw">ggsave</span>(<span class="dt">filename =</span> <span class="kw">paste</span>(cntry, <span class="st">&quot;_gdpPercap.png&quot;</span>, <span class="dt">sep =</span> <span class="st">&quot;&quot;</span>), <span class="dt">plot =</span> my_plot)

}</code></pre>
<p>At this point, we do have a functioning for loop. For each item in the <code>country_list</code>, the for loop will iterate over the code within the <code>{ }</code>, changing <code>cntry</code> each time as it goes through the list. And we can see it works because we can see them appear in the files pane at the bottom right of RStudio!</p>
<p>Great! And it doesn’t matter if we just use these three countries or all the countries–let’s try it.</p>
<p>But first let’s create a figure directory and make sure it saves there since it’s going to get out of hand quickly. We could do this from the Finder/Windows Explorer, or from the “Files” pane in RStudio by clicking “New Folder” (green plus button). But we are going to do it in R. A folder is called a directory:</p>
<pre class="sourceCode r"><code class="sourceCode r"><span class="kw">dir.create</span>(<span class="st">&quot;figures&quot;</span>) 

<span class="co">## create a list of countries</span>

<p>This worked, but we got a warning message with the if statement.

We know that if any are yes, all are yes, but you can imagine that this could lead to problems down the line if you <em>didn’t</em> know that. So let’s be explicit:</p>

<p>OK so this is working as we expect! Note that we do not need an <code>else</code> statement above, because we only want to do something (add a subtitle) if one condition is met.

<p>Note that this works because we know there are only two conditions, <code>Estimated == yes</code> and <code>Estimated == no</code>.

<p>Github was developed for social coding (i.e., sort of like an open source Wikipedia for programmers). Consequently, much of the functionality and terminology of Github (e.g., branches and pull requests) will not be relevant for most scientists.</p>
<p><strong>We will skip over all this stuff!</strong></p>
<p>To get the full functionality of Github, you will eventually want to learn other concepts.</p>
<p><strong>But, this can wait.</strong></p>
<p>Basically, we have figured out exactly what you need to know to get started!</p>
<div id="what-are-git-and-github" class="section level2">
<h2><span class="header-section-number">4.1</span> What are Git and Github?</h2>
<p>Git and GitHub are two distinct programs, but I think of them as a bundle because I always use them together.</p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Git</strong> is a version control system that lets you track changes to files over time.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Github</strong> is a website for storing your git versioned files remotely. It has many nice features to be able visualize differences between <a href="https://help.github.com/articles/rendering-and-diffing-images/">images</a>, <a href="https://help.github.com/articles/mapping-geojson-files-on-github/">rendering</a> &amp; <a href="https://github.com/blog/1772-diffable-more-customizable-maps">diffing</a> map data files, <a href="https://help.github.com/articles/rendering-csv-and-tsv-data/">render text data files</a>, and <a href="https://help.github.com/articles/rendering-differences-in-prose-documents/">track changes in text</a>.</p></li>

<li>Ends (or, nearly ends) the horror of keeping track of versions.
Basically, we get away from this:
<br />
<br />
<img src="img/MessySaves.png" />
<br />
<br />
When you open your repository, you only see the most recent version. But, it easy to compare versions, and you can easily revert to previous versions.
<br />
<br /></li>
<li>Provides peace of mind because you make changes to your work…and know that you can easily access earlier versions.</li>
<li>Improves collaborative efforts. Different researchers can work on the same files at the same time!</li>
<li>It is easy to share and distribute files through the Github website.</li>
<li>Your files are available anywhere, you just need internet connection!</li>
</ol>
<p>We’ll interface with GitHub from our local computers using RStudio because it works well with the R/RStudio workflow. But, there are many other ways to interact with GitHub, including GitHub’s Desktop App or the command line (<a href="http://stat545.com/git02_git-clients.html">here is Jenny Bryan’s list of git clients</a>).</p>
<p>At some point you will need to use the command line to interface with Git, but this isn’t necessary for starting. There are great resources for learning the command line, check out <a href="http://remi-daigle.github.io/2016-04-15-UCSB/shell/">this tutorial from SWC at UCSB</a>.</p>

<h3><span class="header-section-number">4.4.2</span> Setup Git &amp; GitHub</h3>
<p>The GitHub setup is a one-time thing! You will only have to do this once per computer. We’ll walk through this together.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>NOTE: If you are a student you can get the micro account which includes 5 private repositories for free (normally a $7/month value). You can sign up for the student account <a href="https://education.github.com/pack">here</a>. Instructors can also request a free organization <a href="https://education.github.com/">account, “Request a discount”</a>.</p>
</blockquote>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li><p>Download and install Git (<a href="https://git-scm.com/downloads" class="uri">https://git-scm.com/downloads</a>)</p></li>
<li><p>Create a <strong>Github</strong> account at <a href="http://github.com" class="uri">http://github.com</a>, if you don’t already have one. For a username, I recommend all lower-case letters, short as you can. I recommend using your <em>.edu email</em>, since you can request free private repositories via <a href="https://education.github.com/">GitHub Education</a> discount.</p></li>
<li><p>You will use the <code>usethis</code> package to configure <strong>git</strong> with global commands, which means it will apply ‘globally’ to all files on your computer, rather than to a specific folder.</p></li>

<p><br></p>
<p><em>BACKUP PLAN</em> If <code>usethis</code> fails, the following is the classic approach to configuring <strong>git</strong>. Open the Git Bash program (Windows) or the Terminal (Mac) and type the following:</p>
<pre><code>    # display your version of git

    # replace USER with your Github user account
    git config --global user.name USER
    
    # replace NAME@EMAIL.EDU with the email you used to register with Github

<p><strong>New(ish) Error on a Mac</strong>
We’ve also seen the following errors from RStudio:</p>
<pre><code>error key does not contain a section --global terminal</code></pre>
<p>and</p>
<pre><code>fatal: not in a git directory</code></pre>
<p>To solve this, go to the Terminal and type:
<code>which git</code></p>
<p><img src="img/git_whichgit.png" width="250px"></p>
<p>Look at the filepath that is returned. Does it say anything to do with Apple?</p>
<p>-&gt; If yes, then the <a href="https://git-scm.com/downloads">Git you downloaded</a> isn’t installed, please redownload if necessary, and follow instructions to install.</p>
<p>-&gt; If no, (in the example image, the filepath does not say anything with Apple) then proceed below:</p>
<p>In RStudio, navigate to: Tools &gt; Global Options &gt; Git/SVN.</p>
<p><img src="img/git_options.png" width="250px"></p>
<p><br></p>
<p>Does the <strong>“Git executable”</strong> filepath match what the url in Terminal says?</p>
<p><br></p>
<p><img src="img/git_options_filepath.png" width="500px"></p>
<p>If not, click the browse button and navigate there.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>Note</em>: on my laptop, even though I navigated to /usr/local/bin/git, it then automatically redirect because /usr/local/bin/git was an alias on my computer. That is fine. Click OK.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Quit RStudio.</p>
<p>Then relaunch RStudio.</p>
<p>Try syncing or cloning, and if that works and then you don’t need to worry about typing into the Terminal, you’re all done!</p>

<div id="create-a-repository-on-github.com" class="section level3">
<h3><span class="header-section-number">4.4.3</span> Create a repository on Github.com</h3>
<p>First, go to your account on github.com and click “New repository”.
<br />
<br />
<img src="img/create_repository.png" />
<br />
<br /></p>
<p>Choose a name. Call it whatever you want (the shorter the better), or follow me for convenience. I will call mine <code>quickstart</code>.</p>
<p>Also, add a description, make it public, create a README file, and create your repo!
<br />
<br />
<img src="img/create_repository_2.png" />
<br />
<br /></p>
<p>The <em>Add gitignore</em> option adds a document where you can identify files or file-types you want Github to ignore. These files will stay in on the local Github folder (the one on your computer), but will not be uploaded onto the web version of Github.</p>
<p>The <em>Add a license</em> option adds a license that describes how other people can use your Github files (e.g., open source, but no one can profit from them, etc.). We won’t worry about this today.</p>
<p>Check out our new repository!</p>
<p>Notice how the README.md file we created is automatically displayed at the bottom. The .md means that it is Markdown (remember how .Rmd was RMarkdown?) so the formatting we learned in the last lesson apply here.

<div id="clone-your-repository-using-rstudio" class="section level3">
<h3><span class="header-section-number">4.4.4</span> Clone your repository using RStudio</h3>
<p>We are going to be cloning a copy of our remote repository on Github.com to our local computers. Unlike downloading, cloning keeps all the version control and user information bundled with the files.</p>
<p><strong>Step 0</strong>: Create your <code>github</code> folder</p>
<p>This is really important! We need to be organized and deliberate about where we want to keep all of our GitHub repositories (since this is the first of many in your career).</p>
<p>Let’s all make a folder called <code>github</code> (all lowercase!) in our home directories. So it will look like this:</p>
<ul>
<li>Windows: <code>Users\[User]\Documents\github\</code></li>
<li>Mac: <code>Users/[User]/github/</code></li>
</ul>
<p>This will let us take advantage of something that is really key about GitHub.com: cloned repositories are saved as folders that you can navigate on your computer. The greatness of this will be evident soon.</p>
<p>So really. Make sure that you have an all-lowercase folder called <code>github</code> in your home directory!!</p>
<p><strong>Step 1</strong>: Copy the web address of the repository you want to clone.
<br /></p>
<p><img src="img/clone_step1.png" /></p>
<p><br />
<br /></p>
<p><strong>Step 2</strong>: from RStudio, go to New Project (also in the File menu).</p>
<p><img src="img/new_project_1.png" />
<br />
<br /></p>
<p><strong>Step 3</strong>: Select Version Control</p>
<p><br />
<br /></p>
<p><img src="img/new_project_2.png" />
<br />
<br /></p>
<p><strong>Step 4</strong>: Select Git</p>
<p><br />
<br /></p>
<p><img src="img/new_project_3.png" />
<br />
<br /></p>
<p><strong>Step 5</strong>: Paste it in the Repository URL field, and type <strong>tab</strong> to autofill the Project Directory name. Make sure you keep the Project Directory Name <strong>THE SAME</strong> as the repository name from the URL.</p>
<p>Save it in your github folder (click on Browse) to do this.</p>
<p><br />
<br /></p>

</div>
<div id="inspect-results" class="section level3">
<h3><span class="header-section-number">4.4.5</span> Inspect results</h3>
<p>If everything went well, the repository will be added to the list located here:
<img src="img/select_project.png" /></p>
<p><br />
<br />
when we cloned this from RStudio, it created an RStudio project, which you can tell because:</p>
<pre><code>- our working directory is set to `~/github/Quickstart`  
- there&#39;s an `.RProj` file in the &quot;Files&quot; tab 
- the project is named in the top right hand corner
- we have a git tab! This is how we will interface with Github.com</code></pre>
<p><br></p>
<p>When you first clone a repo through RStudio, RStudio will add an <code>.Rproj</code> file to your repo folder. If you didn’t add a <code>.gitignore</code> file when you originally created the repo on GitHub.com, RStudio will also add this for you. These will show up with little yellow <code>?</code> icons in your git tab. This is GitHub’s way of saying: “ooohh…..something changed in the repository”. In this case, when you click the box to stage them, they will turn into <code>A</code>s because they have been added to the repo.</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>And the repository will be saved to the Github folder on your computer:
<br />
<br /></p>
<p><img src="img/cloned_repository.png" />
<br />
<br /></p>
<p>Ta da!!!! The folder doesn’t contain much of interest, but we are going to change that.</p>
</div>
<div id="add-files-to-our-local-repo" class="section level3">
<h3><span class="header-section-number">4.4.6</span> Add files to our local repo</h3>
<p>The repository will contain:</p>
<ul>
<li>.gitignore file</li>
<li>README.md</li>
<li>Rproj</li>
</ul>
<p>And, I typically create the following:</p>
<ul>
<li>folders for “data” and “figures”<br />
</li>
<li>R scripts</li>
<li>etc.</li>
</ul>
<p>We can use the Git tab of RStudio to monitor changes to files in the local repository. When files change, RStudio uses the following codes to describe how the files have been modified:</p>
<p><img src="img/modified.png" /></p>
<p>We will demonstrate this by copying a file into the repository folder on my computer. This file will be added to the Git tab beside a green box with an “A”!</p>
<p>From this, you can see how the repository is being tracked, even when changes aren’t made through RStudio.</p>
<p>We can also make changes through RStudio!</p>

<div id="committing-your-changes-and-syncing-with-github.com" class="section level3">
<h3><span class="header-section-number">4.4.7</span> Committing your changes and syncing with GitHub.com</h3>
<p>Eventually you will want to commit the files you have created in your local repository and then send them to GitHub.com</p>
<p>I tend to do this every time I finish a task (basically when I start getting nervous that I will lose my work). Once something is committed, it is very difficult to lose it.</p>
<p>Committing saves the current saved version of your files to the official Git History. The commit includes all the staged files as well as a corresponding commit message (which you will write) and a unique identifier called a SHA ID. When you are ready to commit your changes, follow these steps:
<br />
<br /></p>
<p><img src="img/commit_overview.png" />
<br />
<br /></p>
<p>We walk through this process below:</p>
<div id="pull" class="section level4">
<h4><span class="header-section-number">4.4.7.1</span> Pull</h4>
<p>From the Git tab, “Pull” the repository. This makes sure your local repository is synced with the remote repository. This is very important if other people are making changes to the repository or if you are working from multiple computers.
<br />
<br /></p>
<p><img src="img/pull.png" />
<br />
<br /></p>
</div>
<div id="stage" class="section level4">
<h4><span class="header-section-number">4.4.7.2</span> Stage</h4>
<p>Stage the files you want to commit. In RStudio, this involves checking the “Staged” boxes:
<br /></p>
<p><img src="img/staged.png" />
<br />
<br /></p>
</div>
<div id="commit" class="section level4">
<h4><span class="header-section-number">4.4.7.3</span> Commit</h4>
<p>Add a commit message that describes the updates you made to these files. The message will be for your reference, so make it something you will find useful.</p>
<p><br /></p>
<p><img src="img/commit.png" />
<br />
<br /></p>
</div>
<div id="push" class="section level4">
<h4><span class="header-section-number">4.4.7.4</span> Push</h4>
<p>You will “Push” to save your local changes to Github.com.</p>

<br /></p>
</div>
</div>
</div>
<div id="explore-remote-github" class="section level2">
<h2><span class="header-section-number">4.5</span> Explore remote Github</h2>
<p>The files you added should be on github.com:
<br /></p>
<p><img src="img/Github_remote.png" />
<br />
<br /></p>
<p><strong>Your turn!</strong></p>
<p>This time let’s edit an existing file instead of adding something new. Open your README file by clicking on it in the Files pane (lower right corner). Write a few lines of text, save, and see what happens in your Git Tab. Sync it to your remote repository (Github.com).</p>
<p>Also, go to your Finder/Windows Explorer, and copy-paste something into your local GitHub repo. Then go back to RStudio and confirm that git tracked it. Remember, git will track anything within that folder (the way Dropbox does), it’s not specific to RStudio!</p>
</div>
<div id="going-back-in-time" class="section level2">
<h2><span class="header-section-number">4.6</span> Going back in time</h2>
<p>One thing that I love about about Github is that it is easy to see how files have changed over time. Usually I compare commits through github.com:

<div id="what-is-good-scientific-writing" class="section level3">
<h3><span class="header-section-number">5.1.1</span> What is good scientific writing?</h3>
<p>Maybe a truthful but uninformative answer is “You know when you read it!”. Being able to understand the message easily is clearly essential. But so is being concise, as words cost journals money and scientists have limited time to read your work. But good scientific writing is more than just being clear and concise. For example, newspaper articles can be clear and concise, but most would say that the journalistic style is inappropriate in a scientific setting. Scientific writing has a host of conventions, not all of which are always made explicit. For example, adhering to the typical structure of a scientific paper, not using colloquialisms, not providing opinion, and not being emotive, to name a few. Although it might feel that such “rules” take the fun out of writing, good scientific writing should not be bland and boring to read. There is room, and indeed a need, for creativity.</p>
</div>
<div id="why-write-well" class="section level3">
<h3><span class="header-section-number">5.1.2</span> Why write well?</h3>
<p>There are many reasons why as scientists we need to write well. First, science is about ideas, and we need to communicate those ideas clearly, effectively and interestingly. An engaged reader will remember what s/he has read. If you fail to communicate effectively, your work will ultimately be of little use to the wider scientific community, resulting in lower uptake and fewer citations.</p>
<p>Second, publishing is the currency of science and requires convincing Editors and Reviewers that your work is robust and meaningful. If your work is not well written, you cannot expect others to understand it. Reviewers can become bogged down in poor writing and sometimes assume that it is indicative of poor science. Reviewers sometimes return poorly written manuscripts directly to the Editor and refuse to review it. At best poor scientific writing leads to delays in the publication process, and at worst outright rejection.</p>
<p>Third, writing clearly will improve your science. If your supervisors, co-authors, and collaborators understand your message and see that you have worked hard to provide a clearly written piece of work, they will provide far better input. If collaborators have to rewrite your work to understand it before they can comment on the content, you will frustrate them immensely and you will receive fewer quality comments about scientific direction and whether your paper hits the mark. In fact, writing well is valued by many collaborators and will lead to more collaborations.</p>
<p>Last, writing well is a fundamental scientific skill (along with, for example, knowledge of the scientific method, quantitative skills, and discipline-specific technical skills), and we have a responsibility to write as well as we can out of respect for others, and to pass this knowledge on. With escalating pressures on academics, fewer of them are taking the time to help students with their writing skills. In the worst cases, supervisors and collaborators to pass on the task of language editing to the peer-review process. This is hugely counterproductive, and simply reinforces the cycle of deterioration in writing skills. Students and the academics who supervise them need to take responsibility in being part of the solution – improving scientific writing by passing on their knowledge to others.</p>
</div>
<div id="why-do-we-have-difficulties-writing-well" class="section level3">
<h3><span class="header-section-number">5.1.3</span> Why do we have difficulties writing well?</h3>
<p>We all have to learn scientific writing – scientific English is no one’s first language! And it is even more difficult if English is not your mother tongue, especially for people who speak languages from outside Europe. So scientific writing does not come easily and requires hard work.</p>
<p>Throughout our studies, we are not taught the concepts that are necessary for good writing. In many countries, the teaching of grammar at school is out of vogue. Scientific writing is also often not taught at university at the undergraduate levels. Nowadays, writing well is not a major learning outcome of most science courses, and assignments are marked predominantly on content and not readability and style. It is also easier to learn scientific writing during your postgraduate study when you can draw on your research, but many countries do not have coursework during postgraduate studies. Unfortunately, during this key developmental period, many supervisors often feel too busy to spend time to improve the writing of their students.</p>
<p>Writing well also takes considerable time and effort. Writing well requires hard work rewriting many drafts, being self-critical of your own work, being afraid to make sometimes substantial changes, and opening up yourself to critique and potential criticism from others. For all these reasons, many scientists have trouble writing well. But scientific writing can be learned.</p>

<div id="how-this-e-book-can-help" class="section level3">
<h3><span class="header-section-number">5.1.4</span> How this e-book can help</h3>
<p>This e-book, <em>How to write well</em>, provides what we think is best practice in terms of scientific writing and simple approaches to avoid common pitfalls. Often errors in writing are corrected or stylistic suggestions made by supervisors,</p>
<p>reviewers or peers, without an explanation, primarily because of the people are time poor. This book is a result of seeing common mistakes by our students, and wanting to teach them how they can improve their writing. During our careers we have developed inherent knowledge about good scientific writing, and this e- book is an attempt to write this down into a coherent whole that is useful to others.</p>
<p>Our approach is to identify a common problem, explain why it is a problem, illustrate it with examples, and show solutions. The content here is based on our experience, is by no means exhaustive, and others might have a different opinion. We are not English teachers or grammar Nazis (although Dave might be…?). We are merely practicing scientists interested in improving our own and others’ writing by sharing our experiences.</p>
<p>Finally, this is part of a series of e-books that can help guide you through your scientific career. Often the best way to learn much of this information is to seek out a mentor. But it can be difficult to find a mentor with the insight, all-round skills, and the time available to provide advice. We have written this series of e- books to provide you with such a mentor – hopefully to provide the knowledge and guidance that you need in your career.</p>
<p>This is the first e-book in the series. The second e-book is <em>Writing a scientific paper</em>. Early on in our careers we are ill-prepared for this challenge. Experienced scientists generally acquire the skills slowly and haphazardly through osmosis or from trial-and-error. Writing a paper thus often seems like a “dark art” – one that some scientists have mastered, but one that is hidden and rarely shared. The e- book <em>Writing a scientific paper</em> shines a light on the process of writing a scientific paper and helps you master it.</p>
<p>The third e-book is <em>Navigating the peer-review process</em>. This often-overlooked part of the publication process involves understanding what different journals expect, what Editors and Reviewers look for, and how the peer-review process works. The e-book <em>Navigating the peer-review process</em> formalises our knowledge, experiences and opinions over the past 25 years of how we have gotten our work published. This e-book should will boost your chances of getting your work published, make it easier to get it published, reduce the time it takes to get it published, and help you formalise your own best practice.</p>
<p>You can read these e-books in any order, and you can read their chapters in any order, dipping into the chapters most relevant to you. These books are targeted at early- and mid-career researchers, but will also provide insights for more experienced scientists. We would appreciate your feedback about what you found useful (or not) in the e-books, and what you would like to see covered in the future.</p>

<h3><span class="header-section-number">5.2.1</span> Remove emotive language</h3>
<p>You should try and state the facts without using emotive terms include <em>alarming</em>, <em>concerning</em>, <em>drastic</em>, <em>lovely</em>, <em>useless</em>, <em>wonderful</em> and <em>worringly</em>. Especially in research focusing on conservation of habitats or iconic species, it is easy to use emotive language. If in doubt, think of the animal as a cockroach and see whether you would use the same language!</p>

<div id="be-consistent" class="section level3">
<h3><span class="header-section-number">5.2.2</span> Be consistent</h3>
<p>Reviewers and examiners often regard sloppiness and lack of attention in scientific writing as an indication of carelessness in your science. Some common examples include:
- Use capitals for proper nouns everywhere
- Whether you choose to use <em>–ize</em> or <em>–ise</em>, be consistent
- Whether you choose to use a space (preferably) or not between numbers and their units, be consistent</p>
</div>
<div id="be-particular" class="section level3">
<h3><span class="header-section-number">5.2.3</span> Be particular!</h3>
<p>There are a bunch of things that are wrong and are just sloppy. Below are some examples, none of which is that important, but show a lack of care that can make the reader question how careful your science is.</p>
<p><strong>Rather than:</strong> La Nina/El Nino</p>
<p><strong>It is:</strong> La Niña/El Niño</p>
<p><strong>Rather than:</strong> <em>Homo spp.</em></p>
<p><strong>It is:</strong> <em>Homo</em> spp. (Only the genus names is italicised).</p>

</div>
<div id="repetition-is-good" class="section level3">
<h3><span class="header-section-number">5.2.4</span> Repetition is good!</h3>
<p>Scientific writing is different from writing novels. For example, in a novel an author might use different terms to identify the same thing to make it more interesting. However, in a scientific paper, repetition of the same term in makes it easier for the Reader to follow.</p>
</div>
<div id="elegant-variation-confuses" class="section level3">
<h3><span class="header-section-number">5.2.5</span> Elegant variation confuses…</h3>
<p>When there are multiple ways to say the same thing, one should not cycle through the different options for “elegant variation” because the use of a different word to a Reader can suggest something different is happening. For example, if a scientist is working on ‘copepods’, it is best to use this consistently throughout the paper, rather than referring to them variedly as ‘small crustaceans’, ‘zooplankton’, ‘maxillopodes’, ‘arthropods’, and ‘insects of the sea’, as the Reader will wonder if the author means different things by the different terms.</p>
<p>In the following example, the Author has switched from using ‘measurement types’ and ‘ecological traits’ to ‘measurement attributes’ and ‘ecological characters’, making the Reader wonder if it is the same quantities being described.</p>
<p><strong>Rather than:</strong> Predictors were divided into two categories: measurement types and ecological traits. For measurement attributes we considered the frequency of sampling. For ecological characters we used a global database.</p>
<p><strong>Try:</strong> Predictors were divided into two categories: measurement types and ecological traits. For measurement types we considered the frequency of sampling. For ecological traits we used a global database.</p>
<p>The following example uses ‘influenced’ and ‘described’ in similar contexts, leaving the Reader wondering whether the author meant to highlight such a difference.</p>
<p><strong>Rather than:</strong> While the abundance of pelagic fish is <em>influenced</em> by food availability and reproduction, their movement is <em>described</em> by oceanographic variables.</p>
<p><strong>Try:</strong> While the abundance of pelagic fish is <em>influenced</em> by food availability and reproduction, their movement is <em>influenced</em> by oceanographic variables.</p>
</div>
<div id="making-word-structure-parallel" class="section level3">
<h3><span class="header-section-number">5.2.6</span> Making word structure parallel…</h3>
<p>Repetition of structure in sentences and paragraphs, and even in headings, can make things easier to follow because it meets the expectations of a Reader. In the following example, the US is at the end of its part of the sentence and the UK is at the start.</p>
<p><strong>Rather than:</strong> …targeting the National Science Foundation in the US and the UK Natural Environment Research Council.</p>
<p><strong>Try:</strong> …targeting the US National Science Foundation and the UK Natural Environment Research Council.</p>
<p>The specification of these three regions is not consistence amongst the parts of the sentence.</p>
<p><strong>Rather than:</strong> The northern region (10-25˚S) is characterised by warm tropical surface waters and a shallow mixed layer, subtropical waters form the central region (25-45˚S), and the most southern region (45-60˚S) verges on cooler subantarctic waters.</p>
<p><strong>Try:</strong> The northern region (10-24˚S) has warm tropical surface waters and a shallow mixed layer, the central region (24-45˚S) has subtropical and well mixed waters, and the southern region (45-50˚S) has cool subantarctic waters.</p>

<h3><span class="header-section-number">5.2.7</span> Be specific</h3>
<p><strong>Rather than:</strong> Aggregations of reef manta rays <em>Manta alfredi</em>, such as those in the Maldives, Western Australia, and Komodo National Park in Indonesia are correlated with productivity.</p>
<p><strong>Try:</strong> Reef manta rays <em>Manta alfredi</em> in the Maldives, Western Australia, and in Indonesia aggregate in regions and at times when there is greater productivity.</p>
<p><strong>Rather than:</strong> The third version of the Receiving Water Quality Model, which is the version used in this study, resolved several limitations of the second version. <strong>Try:</strong> We used the third version of the Receiving Water Quality Model, which resolved several limitations of the second version, including X, Y and Z.</p>
<p><strong>Rather than:</strong> As a consequence, many diatoms exhibit a discontinuous seasonal occurrence that usually coincides with the introduction of nutrients such as during spring blooms.</p>
<p><strong>Try:</strong> Consequently, many diatoms peak during spring when nutrients and light are available.</p>
<p><strong>Rather than:</strong> etc.</p>
<p><strong>Try:</strong> Remove etc. from lists or precede it with “such as” or “including”,</p>
<p><strong>Why?:</strong> “etc.” is vague and everyone will think of different things. Using “such as” or “including” makes it clear you are only listing some of the options.</p>

<div id="be-formal-not-colloquial" class="section level3">
<h3><span class="header-section-number">5.2.8</span> Be formal, not colloquial</h3>
<p>Scientific writing is a formal writing style and using colloquialisms are not appropriate. For example, using a phrase we might commonly use in everyday conversation such as “something is cool” is not appropriate (unless referring to temperature!). It might be more appropriate, however, in a scientific talk, to show you were excited about your results.</p>
<p><strong>Rather than:</strong> Like</p>
<p><strong>Try:</strong> Such as</p>

<div id="typeset-equations-properly" class="section level3">
<h3><span class="header-section-number">5.2.9</span> Typeset equations properly</h3>
<p>If using Word, equations should be included using the Equation Editor, as numbers and variables are treated differently (e.g., variables are italicised) and the typesetting is clearer (e.g., for quotients). It is also better to have units in text rather than equation</p>
<p><strong>Rather than:</strong> <em>MR (calories kg<sup>-1</sup> day<sup>-1</sup>) = (68.9+177.8 * W) * 3.25 / (W * 24)</em></p>

<div id="occur" class="section level3">
<h3><span class="header-section-number">5.5.1</span> Occur</h3>
<p>“Occur” is often used too frequently. In one publication we commented on, the person used “occur/occurs/occurring/occurrence” 8 times in the Introduction, 11 times in the Methods, 44 times in the Results, and 49 times in the Discussion, and she was unaware she was over-using it. Here is an example from one paragraph:</p>

<h3><span class="header-section-number">5.5.2</span> Important/crucial/critical</h3>
<p>The words “important”, “crucial” and “critical” are overused. If we say everything is important, crucial or critical, then they lose their impact and meaning. These words can be powerful when used sparingly and if the reasoning behind them is explained. If they are used multiple times in a paper, these words can often be removed with no ill effect. Valuable can often be used instead, but should also be followed by an explanation.</p>

<h2><span class="header-section-number">5.6</span> Confusing word pairs</h2>
<p>Here are some confusing word pairs and how to select the correct word.</p>
<p><em><strong>‘A’</strong></em> vs <em><strong>‘an’</strong></em></p>
<p>We know that ‘a’ is used before a word starting with a consonant, and ‘an’ is used before a word starting with a vowel. But, which sounds better?</p>
<p>“An university degree” or “A university degree”?</p>
<p>Here even though ‘university’ starts with a vowel, the ‘u’ makes the sound of the consonant ‘y’ (as in ‘yellow’) and thus sounds better with an ‘a’. So the rule that ‘an’ should precede words that start with a vowel is a generalization that does not cover all situations. An addendum to this rule is that ‘a’ should precede words where the first letter makes the sound of a consonant. Similarly, ‘an’ should precede words where the first letter makes the sound of a vowel.</p>
<p>It is worth noting that some writers use “a hypothesis” and others use “an hypothesis”. We prefer using “a hypotheisis”.</p>

<h3><span class="header-section-number">5.6.3</span> ‘Aims’ vs ‘objectives’</h3>
<p>Although some authors use these interchangeably, careful writers distinguish them. Aims (and similarly goals) are general statements and are usually long- term or big picture. Objectives are specific, concrete statements that are often short-term, and can follow the SMART framework (Specific, Measurable, Accurate, Reasonable and Time-bound). Aims are often strategic in nature whereas objectives are more tactical.</p>

<h3><span class="header-section-number">5.6.4</span> ‘All together’ vs ‘Altogether’</h3>
<p>‘Altogether’ means ‘overall’ or ‘completely’. ‘All together’ pertains to a group and means ‘everyone’ or everything-together’.</p>
<p>One way of assessing which to use is to test the sentence without the word ‘all’. If the sentence remains intact and comprehensible without ‘all’, it means the appropriate adverb is ‘all together’. If it no longer makes sense after ‘all’ has been removed, ‘altogether’ should be used.</p>

<p>‘Complement’ means ‘something that completes or brings to perfection.’ A <em>compliment</em> is an expression of praise. Almost all scientific uses are ‘complement’.</p>

<h3><span class="header-section-number">5.6.10</span> ‘Effect’ vs ‘Affect’</h3>
<p>‘Effect’ and ‘affect’ are probably the two words that are regularly confused in scientific writing. ‘Affect’ is a verb meaning ‘to influence’. ‘Effect’ is usually a noun meaning result, but it can also (more rarely) be used as a verb meaning to cause. ‘Effect’ as a noun is followed by the preposition ‘on’ and preceded by an article (‘a’, ‘an’, ‘the’).</p>

<h3><span class="header-section-number">5.6.12</span> ‘Estimated’ vs ‘Measured’ vs ‘Quantified’ vs ‘Determined’ vs ‘Assessed’</h3>
<p>These verbs all have somewhat similar meanings, but there are nuanced differences. They are generally not used interchangeably. It is worthwhile giving some thought to which is appropriate in different circumstances, but one should not cycle through the different options for “elegant variation” because the use of a different word to a Reader can suggest something different is happening. Although it is difficult to give hard-and-fast rules, and it can be slightly different depending on discipline, but here are some rules-of-thumb.</p>
</div>
<div id="measured" class="section level3">
<h3><span class="header-section-number">5.6.13</span> Measured</h3>
<p>Measured is used when a relatively simple instrument is used to make a measurement. Although in the following examples it is correct grammatically to use estimated, quantified, assessed, quantified or determined instead of measured, measured is more appropriate.</p>
<p><strong>Example:</strong> We measured the temperature of seawater using a thermometer.</p>
<p><strong>Example:</strong> We used an anemometer to measure wind strength and direction.</p>
</div>
<div id="estimated" class="section level3">
<h3><span class="header-section-number">5.6.14</span> Estimated</h3>
<p>Estimated is less precise than measured. We often measure physical quantities and estimate biological quantities.</p>
<p><strong>Example 1:</strong> We estimated the density of fish using visual transects.</p>
<p><strong>Example 2:</strong> You estimate the density of copepods in the surface water</p>
</div>
<div id="assessed" class="section level3">
<h3><span class="header-section-number">5.6.15</span> Assessed</h3>
<p>Assessed is generally used when testing a hypothesis, answering a question, or drawing conclusions from data.</p>
<p><strong>Example:</strong> We assessed whether the density of fish was related to habitat quality.</p>
</div>
<div id="quantified" class="section level3">
<h3><span class="header-section-number">5.6.16</span> Quantified</h3>
<p>Quantified is typically used when you want to find a count, amount or a percentage of something.</p>
<p><strong>Example:</strong> We quantified the number of fish on the reef.</p>
</div>
<div id="determined" class="section level3">
<h3><span class="header-section-number">5.6.17</span> Determined</h3>
<p>Can be used when experimental values recorded by an instrument have to be processed to obtain the values.</p>
<p><strong>Example 1:</strong> We determined the chlorophyll concentations by measuring the fluorescence.</p>
<p><strong>Example 2:</strong> We determined that copepods stop feeding at food concentrations &lt;0.01 mg.m3 of chl-a.</p>
</div>
<div id="led-vs-lead" class="section level3">
<h3><span class="header-section-number">5.6.18</span> ‘Led’ vs ‘Lead’</h3>
<p>Mixing these two is a very common mistake in scientific writing.</p>
<p><em>Led</em> is the past tense and past participle of the verb <em>to lead</em> (rhymes with <em>bead</em>). Lead (rhymes with <em>bead</em>) is a noun referring to an initiative or a position at the front.</p>
<p>Lead (rhymes with <em>red</em>) is also a noun referring to the metal.</p>
<p><em>"</em>The Australian programme is led by the University of Queensland, which is also the lead institution in the International Consortium of Lead Research Institutions."</p>

<div id="lesser-vs-fewer" class="section level3">
<h3><span class="header-section-number">5.6.19</span> ‘Lesser’ vs ‘Fewer’</h3>
<p>‘Lesser’ refers to quantity, whereas ’fewer refers to number.</p>
</div>
<div id="maybe-vs-may-be" class="section level3">
<h3><span class="header-section-number">5.6.20</span> ‘Maybe’ vs ‘May be’</h3>
<p>“Maybe” is an adverb and refers to a choice. “Maybe” means “perhaps” when used as an adverb and denotes a choice. A simple trick of finding out if you have used “maybe” in the right place is by interchanging “maybe” with “perhaps.” The sentence should refer to a choice and make sense.</p>
<p><strong>Rather than:</strong> The jellyfish collected by the Continuous Plankton Recorder are primarily epipelagic, but <em>may be</em> not neustonic.</p>
<p><strong>It is:</strong> The jellyfish collected by the Continuous Plankton Recorder are primarily epipelagic, but <em>maybe</em> not neustonic.</p>
<p><strong>Rather than:</strong> A decline of mud content in sediments took place over extensive areas, <em>may be</em> because of the removal of all mussel beds around 1990.</p>
<p><strong>It is:</strong> A decline of mud content in sediments took place over extensive areas, <em>maybe</em> because of the removal of all mussel beds around 1990.</p>
<p>“May be” is a verb and refers to a possibility. The way to check if “may be” is correct, is to substitute “could be” or “would be” in its place. If it makes sense, the usage is correct.</p>
<p><strong>Rather than:</strong> It maybe difficult to separate from’ ‘Coelenterate tissue’’ if the bell is not found.</p>
<p><strong>It is:</strong> It may be difficult to separate from’ ‘Coelenterate tissue’’ if the bell is not found.</p>
<p><strong>Rather than:</strong> Generally, all individuals are counted, but for particularly dense samples a sub-sample maybe counted.</p>
<p><strong>It is:</strong> Generally, all individuals are counted, but for particularly dense samples a sub-sample may be counted.</p>
</div>
<div id="may-vs-might-vs-could" class="section level3">
<h3><span class="header-section-number">5.6.21</span> ‘May’ vs ‘Might’ vs ‘Could’</h3>
<p>Some journals prefer ‘might’ rather than ‘may’ because ‘may’ can have a connotation of permission. ‘Could’ is often stronger than ‘may’ or ‘might’ and thus is preferable sometimes.</p>
</div>
<div id="past-vs-last" class="section level3">
<h3><span class="header-section-number">5.6.22</span> ‘Past’ vs ‘Last’</h3>
<p>There is not much difference, but careful writers prefer ‘past’. This is because ‘last’ can have the connotation of finality; there can be nothing after the last. It is thus preferable to use ‘past’ when referring to the period of time leading up to the present.</p>
</div>
<div id="practice-vs-practise" class="section level3">
<h3><span class="header-section-number">5.6.23</span> ‘Practice’ vs ‘Practise’</h3>
<p>‘Practice’ is a noun referring to the application of an idea (‘the practice of science’), the exercise of a profession (‘he left scientific practice’), customary procedure (‘it was common practice’), or repeated exercise or performance (‘knowing his times table required a lot of practice’)</p>
<p>‘Practise’ is a verb meaning to perform an activity or skill repeatedly to improve one's proficiency (‘He practised his dissection techniques’, or to observe or work at something (‘She practises science’)</p>
<p><em>Example:</em> You can practise your grammar at English Practice.</p>
<p>Note that in US English, ‘practise’ is not used at all, only ‘practice’ for both meanings. If unsure, do what the Americans do and use practice!</p>
</div>
<div id="predominate-vs-predominant" class="section level3">
<h3><span class="header-section-number">5.6.24</span> Predominate vs Predominant</h3>
<p>Predominate is a verb. Predominant is the adjective; as an adverb, predominantly (not "predominately").</p>
<p><strong>Example:</strong> Brown eye colour is the predominant trait</p>
<p><strong>Example:</strong> Brown eye colour predominates in humans.</p>
</div>
<div id="principle-vs-principal" class="section level3">
<h3><span class="header-section-number">5.6.25</span> ‘Principle’ vs ‘Principal’</h3>
<p>‘Principle’ is always a noun and is a ‘basic truth’ or ‘rule’</p>
<p>‘Principal’ can be an adjective or a noun. As an adjective it means ‘most important’. As a noun it means an “administrator” or "sum of money’. Note that when principal is used as a noun (e.g. <em>principal</em> of a school or the <em>principal</em> of a loan), it is the shortened form of a phrase (‘<em>principal teacher</em>’ or ‘<em>principal</em> sum’).</p>
<p><em>Hint:</em> A useful way to remember which one to use is: "If you can substitute ‘main’ (which contains an ‘a’), use <em>principal</em> (which also contains an ‘a’). If you can substitute ‘rule’ (which ends in ‘le’), use <em>principle</em> (which also ends in ‘le’) (William and Mary Morris, <em>Harper Dictionary of Contemporary Usage</em>. Harper &amp; Row, 1975).</p>
<p>“The principal reason that allometry is a scientific principle is principally that size governs the physiological, biological and ecological processes of plants and animals.”</p>

<div id="should-vs-could" class="section level3">
<h3><span class="header-section-number">5.6.26</span> Should vs Could</h3>
<p>Stating something “should” be done, rather than “could” be done, can be interpreted as too prescriptive and even a bit arrogant. It is usually better to say “could”.</p>
<p><strong>Rather than:</strong> Further studies should investigate vertical water column biomass structure as concentrated zooplankton prey densities may occur deeper at this site.</p>
<p><strong>Try:</strong> Further studies could investigate vertical water column biomass structure as concentrated zooplankton prey densities may occur deeper at this site</p>
</div>
<div id="toward-vs-towards" class="section level3">
<h3><span class="header-section-number">5.6.27</span> ‘Toward’ vs ‘Towards’</h3>
<p>These are interchangeable. US and Canadian writers ‘towards’ and British and other English writers prefer ‘towards’. The same is true for ‘backwards/fowards’ and ‘backward/forward’ when used as adverb in the UK and US respectively. But when used as an adverb ‘Something is backward compatible’ or ‘She is forward- looking’, then it never has an ‘s’.</p>
</div>
<div id="where-vs-when" class="section level3">
<h3><span class="header-section-number">5.6.28</span> ‘Where’ vs ‘When’</h3>
<p>Think about whether the sentence is talking about space or time. For example:</p>
<p><strong>Rather than:</strong> “Where <em>M. birostris</em> were observed with their cephalic fins firmly rolled up and not engaging in any other activity, behaviour was designated as cruising.”</p>
<p><strong>Try:</strong> “When <em>M. birostris</em> were observed with their cephalic fins firmly rolled up and not engaging in any other activity, behaviour was designated as cruising.”</p>
</div>
<div id="which-vs-that" class="section level3">
<h3><span class="header-section-number">5.6.29</span> ‘Which’ vs ‘That’</h3>
<p>Distinguishing these two words can help to make intended relationships unmistakable, which is important in reporting scientific information. If the clause can be omitted without leaving the modified noun incomplete, use which and enclose the clause within commas or parentheses; otherwise, use that.</p>
<p>Careful users of English distinguish the two. A ‘that’ should be used before a restrictive clause and ‘which’ before a non-restrictive clause. A restrictive clause is one that defines the situation and cannot be removed. A non-restrictive clause is separated by commas and is an additional piece of information that can be removed from the sentence without altering the meaning.</p>
<p>For example, which of the following is correct:</p>
<p>“Chickens that are well fed produce many eggs”
“Chickens, which are well fed, produce many eggs”
“Chickens which are well fed produce many eggs”</p>
<p>The 1st one is correct, because only chickens that are well fed will produce many eggs. In the 2nd sentence, removing the ‘which are well fed’ separated by commas, leaves us with a sentence ‘Chickens produce many eggs’ that has a different meaning to the first sentence and is untrue (chickens produce no eggs when they are starving). In the 3rd sentence, it is better to replace the ‘which’ with ‘that’, as a clause with ‘which’ should be separated by commas and it is not then the restrictive clause that is needed here. Here is another example:</p>
<p>“Copepods that are the world’s most abundant metazoans are ubiquitous.” “Copepods, which are the world’s most abundant metazoans, are ubiquitous.” “Copepods which are the world’s most abundant metazoans are ubiquitous.” Here the 2nd one is correct. The ‘which are the world’s most abundant metazoans’ is a non-restrictive clause, and removing this clause does not change the meaning of the sentence ‘Copepods are ubiquitous’.</p>
<p>Although this might seem to be splitting hairs (or setae in the case of copepods!), it helps the Reader more easily follow your writing.</p>

<h3><span class="header-section-number">5.7.1</span> Apostrophes</h3>

<div id="commas" class="section level3">
<h3><span class="header-section-number">5.7.3</span> Commas</h3>
<p>Commas make your writing more readable and sometimes are essential for correct meaning. A comma is used to break up two clauses where a pause is needed between them. The pause can be used to introduce a new idea or to separate items in a list. A comma often helps to separate clauses that being with “but” or “with”, and at pauses at start of sentences, say after “Similarly,”.</p>
<p>The following sentence is more readable with a comma after “reproduction”.</p>
<p><strong>Rather than:</strong> While the abundance of pelagic fish is influenced by food availability and reproduction their movement is influenced by oceanographic variables.</p>
<p><strong>Try:</strong> While the abundance of pelagic fish is influenced by food availability and reproduction, their movement is influenced by oceanographic variables.</p>
<p>Similarly, a comma after “live weight” makes the following sentence clearer.</p>
<p>Without the comma after “live weight”, you have to read the first sentence multiple times to understand its meaning.</p>
<p><strong>Rather than:</strong> As data were expressed in terms of live weight conversion factors were used again to determine the weight of consumable seafood in tonnes.</p>
<p><strong>Try:</strong> As data were expressed in terms of live weight, conversion factors were used to determine the weight of consumable seafood in tonnes.</p>
<p>Often a comma is needed for clarity in a list when there are multiple “ands”. In the following, the comma after “flows” makes the list much easier to read.</p>
<p><strong>Rather than:</strong> The tidal range, flood and ebb flows and reef morphology create patterns in zooplankton accumulation and productivity around islands.</p>
<p><strong>Try:</strong> The tidal range, flood and ebb flows, and reef morphology create patterns in zooplankton accumulation and productivity around islands.</p>
<p>Sometimes the meaning of a sentence can be changed entirely depending on if and where a comma is used.</p>
<p><strong>Version 1:</strong> While this hypothesis has not been formally tested, at least for Irukandji it appears to be fairly reliable. (The hypothesis has not been tested but appears to be reliable for Irukandji)</p>
<p><strong>Version 2:</strong> While this hypothesis has not been formally tested, at least for the Irukandji <em>Carukia barnesi</em>, it does appear to be fairly reliable. (The hypothesis has not been tested for Irukandji, but it appears reliable for other species)</p>
<p>And one last example to illustrate that you can get yourself into real trouble with the (mis)-use of commas. This appeared in the Times, intended as a description of a Peter Ustinov documentary:</p>
<p><strong>Hmmm:</strong> Highlights of his global tour include encounters with Nelson Mandela, an 800-year-old demigod and a dildo collector.</p>
<p>Do not omit commas before conjunctions in compound sentences.</p>
</div>
<div id="spaces" class="section level3">
<h3><span class="header-section-number">5.7.4</span> Spaces</h3>
<p>Historically writers have used two spaces after a fullstop, but now the norm is to use one space. This is the standard in scientific journals. It also makes your work a bit shorter, which is always good. You can search for two spaces and replace with one space once ready to submit.</p>
<p>Most journals use a space between numbers and units. Usually journals do not leave a space between the number and units of °C, %, °N, °S, °E, °W.</p>

<div id="hyphens" class="section level3">
<h3><span class="header-section-number">5.7.5</span> Hyphens</h3>
<p>Hyphening of compound or unit modifiers is often needed to clarify what is modifying what. For example, a small-grain harvest (harvest of small grain) is different from a small grain harvest (small harvest of all grain). A man eating fish is different from a man-eating fish!

<div id="short-and-simple-sentences" class="section level2">
<h2><span class="header-section-number">5.8</span> Short and simple sentences</h2>
<p>There is a tendency in scientific writing to have long, complex sentences, making it difficult for the Reader to follow. Your work will be cited more if you use shorter and more understandable sentences. If you need to have a long sentence, follow it with a short sentence to give the Reader a rest.</p>
<p>One way of assessing how convoluted your writing is, is to use a Fog Index. Gunnings’s Fog Index is the best known and measures the level of reading difficulty of any document. It is an estimate of the education grade/year that a Reader would need to understand your work. It can be calculated at <a href="http://gunning-fog-index.com/index.html"><span class="underline">http://gunning-fog-index.com/index.html</span>.</a></p>
<p>Gunning’s Fog Index = <span class="math display">\[(average number of words per sentence) + (number of words of 3 syllables or more)\]</span> × 0.4</p>
<p>The Bible, Shakespeare and Mark Twain all have Fog Indexes of about 6. Time, Newsweek, and the Wall Street Journal average about 11. Scientific writing has higher Fog Indexes because of the nature of the content, but it is worth calculating yours for different pieces of work and try to reduce it. If your Fog Index soars then you might lose your readers in the fog!</p>
<p>Microsoft Word calculates two other indexes for you. The Flesch Reading Ease Test is on a 100-point scale, with the higher the score the easier it is to read. The Flesch-Kincaid Grade Level Test rates text on a U.S. school grade level, similar to the Gunnings Fog Index, with a score of 7 meaning that a seventh grader can understand it. You can calculate these directly in your Word documents. In Windows, under Word ‘Options’, click ‘Proofing’, select ‘Check grammar with spelling’, and under ‘When correcting grammar in Word’ select ‘Show readability statistics check box’. For a Mac, go to Word ‘Preferences’, select ‘Spelling and Grammar’, and check ‘Show readability statistics’. When you then go through and use Tools Spelling and Grammar, Word will give you scores for the Flesch Reading Ease Test and the Flesch-Kincaid Grade Level Test.</p>
<div id="can-you-say-something-more-simply-make-explicit-statements" class="section level3">
<h3><span class="header-section-number">5.8.1</span> Can you say something more simply? Make explicit statements</h3>
<p>Many scientists are reluctant to state facts explicitly, constantly couching expressions in vague terms. Maybe the logic is that if you are not making definitive statements then you can never be wrong. However, this means you end up saying very little, and what you do say confuses rather than informs. Remember words cost money for a journal (in terms of space) so be concise. A key skill in science is to be clear what we know and state those explicitly, and what we suspect/think and couch those more carefully. Many times, explicit statements are much clearer.</p>
<p><strong>Rather than:</strong> Some reef fish are known to farm algae, which shifts the benthos from a bare surface to an algal covered benthos.</p>
<p><strong>Try:</strong> Some reef fish farm algae, which shifts the seafloor from a bare surface to one covered by algae.</p>
<p><strong>Rather than:</strong> These organisms may require mechanisms of motility to access nutrients and preferred environmental conditions.</p>
<p><strong>Try:</strong> These organisms are motile so they can access nutrients and their preferred environmental conditions.</p>
<p><strong>Rather than:</strong> The possibility of vertical adjustment of species as a response to climate change has been shown at a large-scale for fish and invertebrate species in various parts of the ocean.</p>
<p><strong>Try:</strong> Fish and invertebrates can move deeper as oceans warm.</p>
<p>In the next example, did the researchers “aim to investigate” the problem, or did they actually “investigate” the problem?</p>

<p><strong>Try:</strong> Here we investigated the relationship between whale shark feeding ecology and the zooplankton community.</p>
<p><strong>Rather than:</strong> There is very little difference of the impact of the different scenarios on evenness.</p>

<h3><span class="header-section-number">5.8.3</span> Removing redundancy in sentences</h3>
<p>Sentences can often be made clearer and shorter by removing redundant and superfluous words. In the following sentence, the last clause “but this remains undemonstrated” is redundant, as it is implied by the third clause “has been hypothesized to cause illness”.</p>
<p><strong>Rather than:</strong> One species in the genus Carybdea, the Australian form of <em>Carybdea xaymacana</em>, has been hypothesised to cause illness, but this remains undemonstrated.</p>
<p><strong>Try:</strong> One species in the genus Carybdea, the Australian form of <em>Carybdea xaymacana</em>, has been hypothesised to cause illness.</p>
<p>In the following example, there is no need to give coordinates when you refer to a map in a figure.</p>
<p><strong>Rather than:</strong> The region was subsetted into five discrete 5° latitudinal by 5° longitudinal cells for analyses (Figure 1). The five regions included the north- south latitudinal gradient with the following coordinates; region 1, 20°S to 25°S, 20°S, 155°E to 160°E; region 2, 25°S to 30°S, 155°E to 160°E; region 3, 30°S to 35°S, 155°E to 160°E; region 4, 35°S to 40°S, 152.5°E to 157.5°E; and region 5, 40°S to 45°S, 150°E to 155°E.</p>
<p><strong>Try:</strong> The region was subsetted into five 5° latitudinal by 5° longitudinal cells for analyses (Figure 1).</p>
<p>In the next example, it is best not to refer back to previous sections of your work (e.g., as described/discussed/mentioned above, as described/discussed/mentioned previously), because it is vague, as you know exactly where, but your Readers do not. You should either assume people have read it or be more explicit about what you are referring to. The same goes for referring to something below.</p>

<div id="active-vs-passive-voice" class="section level3">
<h3><span class="header-section-number">5.9.3</span> Active vs Passive voice</h3>
<p>There are two voices in English – active and passive. The active voice is often more direct, clearer and vivid, and is preferred for scientific writing and giving instructions. However, the passive voice is preferred when the subject of the sentence is implied, indefinite, general, unimportant, or if the writer is trying to increase vagueness or suspense. The passive voice often uses the word ‘by’ and is usually longer. The active voice often used personal pronouns (I, We, His, Her, Us). Historically, it has been frowned upon to use personal pronouns in scientific writing, perhaps because science should be independent of personal biases and detached from the researchers themselves. We are often taught in our undergraduate studies that using personal pronouns in scientific writing is anathema and many traditional scientists still reject it.</p>
<p>In more recent years, however, there has been a push toward using the active rather than the passive voice in scientific writing because it is more direct and shorter. Our advice is to write in the active voice and use personal pronouns wherever you need to. Occasionally you will get an Editor who might not like it, but this is increasingly rare. If you do strike an Editor who does not like it, change it. Microsoft Word will highlight passive sentences and help you change them.</p>
<p>Examples of passive vs active voice follow. Which voice do you prefer?</p>
<p>##Passive:## Gravity was discovered by Galileo. <em>Here ‘Gravity’ is the subject, ‘Galileo’ is the object and ‘was discovered by’ is the verb.</em></p>
<p>##Active:## Galileo discovered gravity. <em>Here ‘Galileo’ is the subject of the sentence, ‘gravity’ is the object and ‘discovered’ is the verb</em></p>
<p>##Passive 1:## An ecosystem model was constructed by us. <em>Here ‘an ecosystem model’ is the subject, ‘us’ is the object, and ‘was constructed by’ is the verb.</em></p>
<p>##Passive 2:## An ecosystem model was constructed. <em>As above, but the object “us” is implied.</em></p>
<p>##Active:## We constructed an ecosystem model. <em>Here ‘We’ is the subject, ‘an ecosystem model’ is the object, and ‘constructed’ is the verb.</em></p>

<p><strong>Try:</strong> Light and nutrients regulate photosynthesis.</p>
</div>
<div id="logical-sequence" class="section level3">
<h3><span class="header-section-number">5.9.4</span> Logical sequence</h3>
<p>It is usually best to use a logical sequence in a sentence, wherever possible. For example, in time (e.g., February before March), space (e.g., describe sites from North to South), phylogenetically (e.g., from simple to complex), or importance (e.g., human stresses on ecosystems that are most to least harmful). When this is not possible, alphabetical order is a good option.</p>
<p>In the next example, transposing ‘weekly and daily’ makes more sense, as the sentence now goes from hourly, through daily, to weekly.</p>
<p><strong>Rather than:</strong> Hourly data were used for the case studies, while weekly and daily means were calculated for time-series analyses.</p>

</div>
<div id="numbers-in-sentences" class="section level3">
<h3><span class="header-section-number">5.9.5</span> Numbers in sentences</h3>

<p>Never write numbers before units.</p>
<p><strong>Rather than:</strong> five m.s-1</p>
<p><strong>It is:</strong> 5 m.s-1</p>
<p>When there are several numbers in a sentence and some are smaller and some are larger than 10, it is clearer for Readers to write them all as numbers.</p>
<p><strong>Rather than:</strong> The three lionesses had 10 cubs.</p>

<p><strong>Example:</strong> Assuming these trends in ocean warming are continued in the future, we hypothesise that: (1) pelagic fish species leading edges would shift further than their trailing edges; (2) shifts would be greater in winter than summer; and (3) shallower species would shift further south than deeper species.</p>

<h3><span class="header-section-number">5.10.1</span> Structure</h3>
<p>Topic sentence and concluding sentences in paragraphs – not appropriate in fictional writing.</p>
<p>The 1st sentence of a paragraph should summarize the paragraph. Thus if you want to skim a paper, you should be able to read the 1st sentence of each paragraph and follow the logic of the paper. This means that when writing a paragraph, keep in mind that it should give the overall message of the paragraph.</p>
<p>Paragraphs should also not be too long. The longer the paragraph, the more difficult it is for the Reader to follow the message, and the more likely the Writer is to meander. Short, punchy paragraphs will best convey your messages.</p>
<p>Here it is useful to separate the single long paragraph into two shorter paragraphs so the Reader does not get the impression that you are saying the same thing twice – it emphasises that one analysis is for Biomass and the other one is for Abundance.</p>
<p><strong>Rather than:</strong> Zooplankton biomass was significantly higher during manta ray feeding events than when manta rays were not feeding or were absent (ANOVA F<sub>(2,87)</sub>=11.41, p=3.98x10-5; Figure 4a).

<h3><span class="header-section-number">5.12.1</span> British or US English</h3>
<p>The Irish playwright Oscar Wilde described America and Britain as “<em>two nations divided by the same language</em>.” Many of the differences between US and British spelling were championed by the American teacher and lexicographer Noah Webster in the early 19th century. He saw the simplification of English spelling as a mark of American independence. Commonwealth nations generally follow British English. Although traditionally British journals have used British English and American journal American English, journals are usually flexible these days with whether you use British or US English. However, the most important advice is to be consistent in your usage. The best ways to do this are to be familiar with different forms, and to choose the English version on your spell checker in your word processor!</p>

<p>The following is a table summarising differences between British and US English, focusing on scientific terms. Some rules are not hard and fast, English is a dynamic language so spelling is in a state of flux.</p>

<h3><span class="header-section-number">6.1.1</span> Cluster</h3>
<p>Getafix is a cluster. That means there are many computers all talking to each-other and sharing resources.</p>
<p>The cluster will assign your job to nodes using the SLURM program.</p>
</div>
<div id="node" class="section level3">
<h3><span class="header-section-number">6.1.2</span> Node</h3>
<p>Each computer in the cluster is called a node. Each node has it’s own cpu’s, memory and graphics card. Nodes all share a common network drive, so all your data is available on all the nodes.</p>
</div>
<div id="cores-and-memory" class="section level3">
<h3><span class="header-section-number">6.1.3</span> Cores and memory</h3>
<p>Most nodes in Getafix have about 24 cores, a few have more and a few have less. Each node also typically has about 250GB of memory.</p>
<p>If I can find a list of the nodes, I’ll add it for reference.</p>
</div>
<div id="login-node" class="section level3">
<h3><span class="header-section-number">6.1.4</span> Login Node</h3>
<p>One node is special, the login node. Strictly speaking, Getafix is the login node, which is why Dogmatix, the older SMP cluster, has access to most of the same resources and nodes. The login node works like any remote computer, you can run jobs on the login node, but out of respect for other users, you should only do setup operations and short tests on the login node.</p>
</div>
<div id="slurm" class="section level3">
<h3><span class="header-section-number">6.1.5</span> SLURM</h3>
<p>SLURM is the program that balances all the jobs between users across the cluster. You specify what you want the cluster to do, and how much time, nodes, cpu’s and memory you think you will need. SLURM then waits until the cluster has enough resources available to run your job and starts the job. If you try to use more resources than you asked for, your job will be killed. If you ask for lots of resources, it might take a while for enough nodes to be available, since smaller jobs will usually fill up the available resources as other jobs end.</p>
</div>
<div id="other-resources" class="section level3">
<h3><span class="header-section-number">6.1.6</span> Other Resources</h3>

<h2><span class="header-section-number">6.3</span> Running jobs on Getafix</h2>
<div id="modules" class="section level3">
<h3><span class="header-section-number">6.3.1</span> Modules</h3>
<p>To allow different versions of software to be used by different users (like python 3.4 versus python 3.6), Getafix uses Linux modules. On Getafix, R is in a module, and won’t work until you load the module. You
can use the default version of a module, or specify a particular version of a module if your job depends on it.</p>
<p>To see what modules are available, type:</p>
<pre class="sourceCode bash"><code class="sourceCode bash"><span class="ex">module</span> avail</code></pre>
<p>When you see a module you want to use, load it with:</p>
<pre class="sourceCode bash"><code class="sourceCode bash"><span class="ex">module</span> load <span class="op">&lt;</span>module name<span class="op">&gt;</span></code></pre>
<p>I use the following modules:</p>
<pre class="sourceCode bash"><code class="sourceCode bash"><span class="ex">module</span> load R
<span class="ex">module</span> load pandoc <span class="co">#rendering rmarkdown into html and pdf</span>
<span class="ex">module</span> load gdal <span class="co">#spatial packages like sf</span>
<span class="ex">module</span> load geos <span class="co">#spatial packages like sf</span>
<span class="ex">module</span> load proj <span class="co">#spatial packages like sf</span></code></pre>
</div>
<div id="r-on-getafix" class="section level3">
<h3><span class="header-section-number">6.3.2</span> R on Getafix</h3>
<p>R on Getafix is pretty similar to R on your local computer, without RStudio.
#
### installing packages</p>
<p>Install packages to a local library in your home directory.</p>
<pre class="sourceCode bash"><code class="sourceCode bash"><span class="ex">module</span> load R
<span class="ex">R</span></code></pre>
<pre class="sourceCode r"><code class="sourceCode r"><span class="kw">install.packages</span>(<span class="st">&quot;foreach&quot;</span>)
<span class="kw">install.packages</span>(<span class="st">&quot;doParallel&quot;</span>)
<span class="kw">install.packages</span>(<span class="st">&quot;sf&quot;</span>)</code></pre>
<p>Accept the default library location unless you have a reason not to.</p>
<p>If your package fails to install, check if there is a system package missing.</p>
<p>For example, to install <code>sf</code>, you need to load more modules:</p>
<pre class="sourceCode bash"><code class="sourceCode bash"><span class="ex">module</span> load R
<span class="ex">module</span> load gdal
<span class="ex">module</span> load geos
<span class="ex">module</span> load proj
<span class="ex">R</span></code></pre>
<p>Now <code>sf</code> should install.</p>
<pre class="sourceCode r"><code class="sourceCode r"><span class="kw">install.packages</span>(<span class="st">&quot;sf&quot;</span>)</code></pre>
<p>If it still does not work, send an email to <a href="mailto:help@its.uq.edu.au" class="email">help@its.uq.edu.au</a>, they have been helpful setting me up when something was missing or broken.</p>
</div>
<div id="parameters-for-rmd-files" class="section level3">
<h3><span class="header-section-number">6.3.3</span> Parameters for Rmd files</h3>
<p>You can pass parameters into Rmd files from the command line. You need to set up the `params` in the YAML header, see
<a href="https://bookdown.org/yihui/rmarkdown/parameterized-reports.html" class="uri">https://bookdown.org/yihui/rmarkdown/parameterized-reports.html</a></p>
<p>Using Rscript, you can render a report using a specified set of parameters like this:</p>
<pre class="sourceCode bash"><code class="sourceCode bash"><span class="va">paramlist=</span><span class="st">&#39;list(nCores =24, gRange = 1:300 )&#39;</span>
<span class="ex">Rscript</span> -e <span class="st">&#39;knitr::opts_knit$set(progress = TRUE, verbose = TRUE); rmarkdown::render(&quot;/data/uqpdyer/demo.Rmd&quot;, params = &#39;&quot;</span><span class="va">${paramlist}</span><span class="st">&quot;&#39;, output_format = &quot;html_notebook&quot;, output_file = &quot;outfile.html&quot;, output_dir = &quot;/data/uqpdyer&quot;, envir = new.env())&#39;</span></code></pre>
<p>This is not as convenient as setting parameters in RStudio or within an R session. You have to be very careful about quotes, and the command line is hard to edit.</p>
<p>Sending parameters to an R script in bulk is much easier, but lacks the reproducability of Rmd.</p>
<div id="parameters-for-script-files" class="section level4">
<h4><span class="header-section-number">6.3.3.1</span> Parameters for script files</h4>
<p>Use the base <code>commandArgs</code> or the <code>optparse</code> package to use command line parameters in your script files</p>
<p>Then you can run the script from the command line like this:</p>
<pre class="sourceCode bash"><code class="sourceCode bash"><span class="ex">Rscript</span> script.R input1 input2</code></pre>
</div>
</div>
<div id="slurm-1" class="section level3">
<h3><span class="header-section-number">6.3.4</span> SLURM</h3>
<p>So far, R has been running on the login node. Some things are easiest to do on the login node, like installing packages and transferring files. Computationally heavy tasks should be done on other nodes. To use the other nodes, you submit jobs with SLURM.</p>
<p>SLURM is a job scheduler. People request jobs by specifying the resources they need and the scripts to run, and SLURM queues the jobs until some nodes are available to run the job. You can also request an
interactive session, but it is more efficient to set up jobs and come back to get the results.</p>
<div id="sbatch" class="section level4">
<h4><span class="header-section-number">6.3.4.1</span> <code>sbatch</code></h4>
<p>The command <code>sbatch</code> is used to submit jobs, which are run when the resources become available.</p>
<p>You use SLURM by calling <code>sbatch</code>:</p>
<pre class="sourceCode bash"><code class="sourceCode bash"><span class="ex">sbatch</span> script.sh</code></pre>
<p>where <code>script.sh</code> looks like</p>
<pre class="sourceCode bash"><code class="sourceCode bash"><span class="co">#!/bin/bash</span>
<span class="co">#SBATCH --ntasks=1</span>
<span class="co">#SBATCH --cpus-per-task=1</span>
<span class="co">#SBATCH --mem-per-cpu=1G</span>
<span class="co">#SBATCH --time=0-00:10</span>

<span class="bu">echo</span> <span class="st">&quot;hello world&quot;</span></code></pre>
<p>The <code>#SBATCH</code> lines at the top are parameters for the sbatch command, you can also include them in the command call:</p>
<pre class="sourceCode bash"><code class="sourceCode bash"><span class="ex">sbatch</span> script.sh --ntasks=1 --cpus-per-task=1 --mem-per-cpu=1G --time=0-00:10 script.sh</code></pre>
<p>Then <code>script.sh</code> can simplify down to:</p>
<pre class="sourceCode bash"><code class="sourceCode bash"><span class="co">#!/bin/bash</span>

<span class="bu">echo</span> <span class="st">&quot;hello world&quot;</span></code></pre>
<p>When working with R, we run scripts or arbitrary code snippets with Rscript, but the <code>sbatch</code> command still expects Rscript to be wrapped in <code>script_for_r.sh</code></p>
<pre class="shell"><code>#!/bin/bash
#SBATCH --ntasks=1
#SBATCH --cpus-per-task=20
#SBATCH --mem-per-cpu=2G
#SBATCH --time=0-01:00

module load R
Rscript myRscript.R</code></pre>
<p>So running <code>sbatch</code> looks the same:</p>
<pre class="sourceCode bash"><code class="sourceCode bash"><span class="ex">sbatch</span> script_for_r.sh</code></pre>
<p>Here is a meaningful r script we can test out. Note that I have specified 20 cpu’s in both <code>script_for_r.sh</code> and <code>myRscript.R</code></p>

<h4><span class="header-section-number">6.3.4.3</span> Many nodes</h4>
<p>So far, we have used only 1 node. The memory and cpu’s are all in the same node, and R behaves in exactly the same way as on your machine, only with more cores. You are clearly limited to a speed up of around 20 times with a single node.</p>
<p>To go beyond the single node limit, you have a few options.</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li>Divide your job up</li>

<ul>
<li>The future.batchtools package lets you submit SLURM jobs from R. The benefit of using future.batchtools is that you write R code using future syntax, then specify a SLURM plan, and all futures at a level specified by the plan are sent off as jobs. The script waits until the job finishes.</li>
<li>I recommend running a single node task with 1 cpu and a modest amount of ram, but a long running time, then all the heavy lifting is done by new jobs submitted by your script.</li>
<li>Take care with this package, I haven’t checked the defaults, but it might request too many resources like Rslurm.</li>

<p>If you want to generate a collection of rendered Rmd files, you have to
write up a script for each set of parameters.</p>
<p>The other way to generate a set of Rmd files with different parameters,
in parallel, is to copy the file and change the parameters in each file.
Then you can use job arrays by naming the files from 1 to n.</p>
<p>The simplest approach I can think of to run many different Rmd files is
to have a shell script, that calls an R script, that renders an Rmd.
Parameters passed to the shell script go all the way down to the Rmd
file.</p>

<p>Use <code>ggsave()</code> for ggplots, and <code>dev.png()</code>, your plotting code, <code>dev.off()</code> for other kinds of R plots.</p>

<h2><span class="header-section-number">6.6</span> Playing nice</h2>
<p>The cluster is a shared resource.</p>
<p>Try to be as precise as possible when allocating resources, so others can use what you don’t need.</p>
<p>Be careful with any package that submits jobs for you (<code>Rslurm</code>,<code>future.batchtools</code>). Check the jobs are requesting a reasonable set of resources.</p>
<div id="parallel-coding-in-r" class="section level3">
<h3><span class="header-section-number">6.6.1</span> Parallel coding in R</h3>
<div id="parlapply-parapply-etc." class="section level4">
<h4><span class="header-section-number">6.6.1.1</span> parlapply, par*apply etc.</h4>
<p>The parallel package gives you par* versions of the apply family of functions.</p>
<p>Easy to drop in if you usually use the apply family from base R, you replace any <code>apply</code>, <code>lapply</code>, <code>sapply</code> with <code>parapply</code>, <code>parlapply</code>, <code>parsapply</code>.</p>
</div>
<div id="foreach-and-dopar" class="section level4">
<h4><span class="header-section-number">6.6.1.2</span> foreach and %dopar%</h4>
<p>The <code>foreach</code> package has a few uses.</p>
<p>First, it changes how you use <code>for</code> loops in R. Base R <code>for</code> loops usually work by changing a variable defined outside the loop. <code>foreach</code> is more like an <code>apply</code>, where a result is returned, so <code>foreach</code> works without needing to use side effects.</p>
<p>Second, because <code>foreach</code> can work without side effects, it can run the loop in parallel easily. There are a number of backends you can use, including <code>doParallel</code>, <code>doMPI</code>, <code>doFuture</code>. You can quickly change how parallel works by replacing <code>%do%</code> with <code>%dopar%</code> and changing the registerDo* function at the start of your script.</p>
<p>If you already like using <code>foreach</code> over the apply family, moving to parallel is easy. The main downside is that <code>foreach</code> is not particularly efficient with resources. If you are mostly using the apply family, switching to <code>foreach</code> is much harder.</p>
</div>
<div id="future" class="section level4">
<h4><span class="header-section-number">6.6.1.3</span> <code>future</code></h4>
<p>The <code>future</code> package is built around the idea of a promise. The promise is “Eventually the variable will have a result assigned to it, but not straight away”. You replace <code>&lt;-</code> with <code>%&lt;-%</code> and the line of code becomes a promise, rather than something to do right away.</p>
<p>Generally, you don’t need to change your code much, just add <code>%</code> around your <code>&lt;-</code> at strategic points, but you can gain a lot of flexibility, and there are many backends.</p>
<p><code>future.apply</code> gives you parallel versions of <code>apply</code>. <code>doFuture</code> mixes <code>future</code> and <code>foreach</code>.</p>
<p><code>future.batchtools</code> spawns jobs on the cluster that return the results into your session. <code>future.callr</code> does local parallel calculations in separate R processes. <code>future</code> alone will do local multiprocessor calculations and use multiple nodes.</p>

<h4><span class="header-section-number">6.6.1.4</span> General Coding habits for going parallel</h4>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li>Put things into lists</li>
</ol>
<ul>
<li>It is easy to loop over lists, and you can quickly parallelise the processing of a list.</li>
</ul>
<ol start="2" style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li>Don’t do graphics in parallel</li>
</ol>
<ul>
<li>Generally speaking, you can specify ggplot objects in parallel, but if you try to print or save them in parallel, R crashes.</li>
<li>You probably have to work very carefully to open multiple <code>dev.png()</code> for plotting base R plots.</li>
</ul>
<ol start="3" style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li>Make functions small</li>
</ol>
<ul>
<li>If you repeat something frequently, put it into a function. You can then put functions into packages. Try to keep functions small, then they are easier to use in parallel. Generally don’t try to work in parallel within a function.</li>
<li>If you want a function to use parallel processing, I strongly recommend you use either <code>future</code> or <code>foreach</code> with <code>%dopar%</code>. By default, they both drop back to sequential processing, but the user can set up parallel processing before calling the function to get speed improvements.</li>
</ul>
<ol start="4" style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li>Look for loops, but don’t use R base <code>for</code> loops</li>
